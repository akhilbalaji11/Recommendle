These Luxury Brands of America exclusive limited-edition pens harness the mystique and power of two mighty dragons: Dubhánach and Glasóg. These pens are more than just writing instruments—they’re a tribute to the ancient tales of mythical beasts and the forces of nature.</p>
<p>The Euphoria fountain pen features facets and an ergonomic design for long periods of comfortable writing. It has a silver Schmidt #6 stainless steel nib, silver clip, and pushes to post.</p>
<p>This fountain pen comes with a standard international converter and one long blue ink cartridge. You can also fill the whole barrel with ink to use as an eyedropper pen with a massive ink capacity.</p>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8"">These limited-edition dragon pens won’t last long—be sure to claim yours before they soar away! Each pen is numbered out of 93.</p>
<p><b>The Legend of Dubhánach and Glasóg:</b></p>
<p>Long ago, in the forgotten lands of mist-shrouded mountains and enchanted forests, two mighty dragons ruled over the realm—Dubhánach, the Black Dragon of the Night, and Glasóg, the Green Dragon of the Verdant Isles. For centuries, they lived in harmony, each guarding a sacred element of the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Dubhánach (doo-VAH-nahk): </strong>The Black Dragon. Guardian of the night, Dubhánach was born from the shadows of the moonless sky. Cloaked in obsidian scales, every breath brought the stillness of the night. His eyes blazed like embers in the dark, and he was said to control the mysteries of the unknown—whispers carried by the wind, secrets hidden in the stars. His fearsome power came from his connection to the dark forces of the world, and many believed that only the bravest could unlock his dark gifts. Dubhánach’s mighty flames, depicted in the fiery red and orange details of the pen, represent the fire of destruction and transformation, burning away the old to make way for new wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Glasóg (GLA-sog): </strong>The Green Dragon. Born from the heart of ancient forests, Glasóg was the protector of life itself. His emerald and sapphire scales shimmered with the vitality of the earth, and his glowing orange eyes pierced through the shadows of the wild. Known as the Bringer of Growth, Glasóg’s fiery breath could set the world ablaze, but from the ashes, new life would always emerge. Legend has it that Glasóg’s power kept nature in balance—forests would grow where his flames touched, and rivers would flow in his wake. The golden flames rising from the base of this pen are a symbol of his dominion over fire, regeneration, and the eternal cycle of life.</p>
<p>But the peace between the two dragons could not last forever. As their realms began to overlap, the tension between Dubhánach's control of the dark and Glasóg's mastery over nature grew. The skies above their land turned to fire as the two dragons clashed, their epic battle said to have shaken the very foundation of the world. Though their war raged for centuries, legend has it that their final breaths were captured in these pens, immortalizing their power for all who dared to wield them.</p>

<p>From BENU:</p>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8"">Presenting three new stunning additions to our Talisman collection: Cat’s Eye, Hawk’s Eye, and Tiger’s Eye. Each unique fountain pen is dedicated to a popular quartz crystal renowned for its distinctive, natural phenomenon called “chatoyancy”. These minerals, highly sought-after for their optical illusions, have been surrounded by myths and legends for centuries.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">We, therefore, considered the stones a perfect fit for our Talisman collection! Each pen is crafted in the corresponding mineral’s color with BENU’s signature splash of sparkles, and comes complete with a leaflet sharing the background story. BENU is thrilled to introduce their new designs, showcasing the mesmerizing beauty and symbolism of these remarkable stones.</p>

<p>BENU is proud to introduce their marvelous new collection of pens, Talisman. This collection is inspired by great legends and the mystical beliefs that surround talismans, amulets, and other magical items used to bring luck, protection, money, love or special abilities. <br><br>Whether you are an avid believer in the magical power of plants, stones, herbs, and crystals, or you remain skeptical to this mysterious and unknown world, there indeed lies a sprinkling of curiosity and intrigue within each of us. Believer or not, we can all admire the fabulous myths and ancient beliefs behind these good luck charms. <br><br>We invite you to step into this hypnotizing realm of folklore and see for yourself if there is any truth to be found beneath the fables. Who knows, perhaps this fascinating magic might make its way into our modern world! <br><br>This Talisman collection is made complete with 5 pens, each named after a special substance: Mandrake, Dragon’s Blood, Peacock Ore, Fox Gloves, and Edelweiss. Drawing inspiration from certain tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by actually infusing a part of each substance into the five different designs. <br><br> Known historically as <em>Sanguis Draconis</em>, Dragon’s Blood has been used in magic rituals and alchemy for centuries. Ancient traders obtained it from small islands, where the dragons were believed to dwell. However, the magical blood wasn’t yielded directly from the dragons, but from a genus of curious trees - the most famous species in horticulture was named <em>Dracaena Draco</em>, otherwise known as the Dragon Tree. The bright red resin that is obtained from <em>Dracaena Draco</em> is surrounded by many ancient myths and legends, one of which is the thrilling tale of the battle between Hercules and Ladon: <br><br>As the Ancient Greek Legend has it, Ladon, a serpent-like dragon, was sent by Hera, the Queen of Heaven, to protect the sacred fruit that she had gifted to Zeus. The hotheaded Hercules was sent on the dangerous task of stealing the Hesperides apples, with the fierce dragon on-guard close by. Against all odds, the mighty Hercules slayed the ferocious Ladon, and the dragon’s blood spilled out over the land, sprouting ‘dragon’ trees. These Dragon Trees, with their long, slender trunks and prickly leaves, continue to bleed the death of Ladon with an oozing, reddish sap whenever cut. <br><br>In old Europe, Dragon’s Blood became a vital component in the alchemical arts and the concocting of magical potions. During the Middle Ages it was used to make healing potions or to mark armor invulnerable and weapons unbreakable.</p>

<p>The African Dream Bean is a climbing vine native to southern Africa, which is used in various ways by traditional communities. However, this curious plant is perhaps most notorious for its ability to induce lucid dreams that enable communication with the spirit world. Some African tribes also use the Dream Bean’s chocolate colored seeds as amulets or good luck charms, stringing them together to create pieces of jewelry. Always fans of exploring the world’s curiosities and turning them into works of art, we’ve chosen this mystical plant as inspiration to our latest BENU creation.</p>

Drawing inspiration from certain tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by actually infusing a part of each substance into the five different designs. <br><br> Most people will recognize the word “edelweiss” from the famous 1965 musical romance, <em>Sound of Music</em>. However, this non-toxic, noble plant, with its snow-white leaves and star-shaped inflorescence, is often associated with certain myths related to proving one’s worth and discovering true love.<br><br> One fable tells the tragedy of a hauntingly beautiful queen with a heart of pure ice. Stories of her beauty reached many doomed suitors, who dared to proclaim love for the queen. Since her frozen heart was unable to love, she soon tired of them and ordered her loyal goblins to throw the hapless men to their deaths. One day, an ordinary shepherd found his way to her cave and the queen fell in love with him. The jealous goblins, fearing their mistress would marry this mortal and abandon them, threw him into the abyss. When she learned of the tragedy, her heart melted enough for her to shed a solitary tear. That tear became the first Edelweiss.<br><br> Although this tragic tale earned Edelweiss its popular name “The Tear of the Snow Queen”, another legend, told by Berthold Auerbach in 1861 in his book, <em>Edelweiss</em>, made the flower a true symbol of eternal love. The tale tells the story of a young man who risks his life to collect rare Edelweiss flowers for his lover as proof of his daring and brave nature.<br><br> With all the mystique surrounding the Edelweiss flower, these tales and fables might not be easy to chew. Accurate or not, this small, potent plant continues to be used in medicine as a remedy against many diseases. Its origins, however, are up to you to decide...</p>

<p>From BENU:</p>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8"">BENU introduces two new editions to its Talisman collection of pens – the Frankincense and the Lily of the Incas. Both substances have a long history of magical and ceremonial use that have inspired these new, exciting designs. One of the oldest documented magical resins, Frankincense has been used in the Middle East and Asia from the Biblical times for religious, spiritual and magical purposes. Although stemming from different parts of the the world, both substances are surrounded by numerous legends and myths. Drawing inspiration from these tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by infusing the namesake substances into each pen’s material.<br></p>

<p>BENU is proud to introduce its marvelous new collection of pens, Talisman. This collection is inspired by great legends and the mystical beliefs that surround talismans, amulets, and other magical items used to bring luck, protection, money, love or special abilities. <br><br>Whether you are an avid believer in the magical power of plants, stones, herbs, and crystals, or you remain skeptical to this mysterious and unknown world, there indeed lies a sprinkling of curiosity and intrigue within each of us. Believe it or not, we can all admire the fabulous myths and ancient beliefs behind these good luck charms. <br><br>We invite you to step into this hypnotizing realm of folklore and see for yourself if there is any truth to be found beneath the fables. Who knows, perhaps this fascinating magic might make its way into our modern world! <br><br>This Talisman collection is made complete with 5 pens, each named after a special substance: Mandrake, Dragon’s Blood, Peacock Ore, Fox Gloves, and Edelweiss. Drawing inspiration from certain tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by actually infusing a part of each substance into the five different designs. <br><br>The mandrake root is native to both the Mediterranean and the Himalayas. With a long history of use in religious and occult practices, this plant is particularly noted for its potent roots, which somewhat resemble the human body.<br><br> One of the earliest mentions of mandrake can be dated back to the Bible. In Genesis 30, Rachel, Jacob’s wife, relies on this special plant to help her conceive a child. With its sweet fragrance that acts as an aphrodisiac, the mention of mandrakes in the Song of Solomon is part of a romantic encounter between Solomon and his new wife. It is suggested that the scripture links the mandrake with sexuality and fertility.<br><br> In the Middle Ages, folk understood that plants bearing resemblances to body parts could be used to treat their associated limbs and organs. Mandrakes can look rather like babies, so those having trouble conceiving would sleep with them under their pillows. And it wasn’t just about mandrakes getting people “in the mood” and fertile! According to Anthony John Carter, as he writes in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2003, medieval folk carried mandrake roots around as good luck charms, hoping the plant would grant them not only wealth and the power to control their destiny, but also the ability to control the destinies of others as well.<br><br> Having a long history of medicinal and magical use - from witches brew to modern medicine - this fantastic plant is still fundamentally part of our lives and certainly continues to work its magic in our modern day society.</p>

<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, or 1.1mm stub, as well as the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.

The Conklin quality control team tests each nib individually to ensure top quality writing performance.</p>
<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>

At the heart of this collection lies stabilized wood, a specially treated wood infused with epoxy to significantly enhance its durability, aesthetic appeal, and workability. Through a meticulous process involving drying, vacuum pressure infusion, and curing, the stabilizing agent deeply penetrates the wood fibers, filling pores and voids. Once hardened, the epoxy transforms the wood into a medium that resists warping, cracking, and moisture, while showcasing a smooth, polished finish. This process not only preserves the natural grain and color but also elevates them, making stabilized wood ideal for applications requiring both beauty and strength—such as luxury pen making.</p>
<p>Each Spectra Fusion pen begins with professionally stabilized maple burl, chosen for its intricate grain patterns and unique character. The stabilization process results in a wood that is hard, dense, and resistant to environmental stresses. On its own, this stabilized burl would already be suitable for precision work and detailed carving, capable of holding fine edges and showcasing vibrant hues.</p>
<p>However, the Spectra Fusion Collection takes innovation a step further by fusing the stabilized wood with hand-poured epoxy resin. This fusion creates a hybrid material that is both structurally superior and visually dynamic. The epoxy—pigmented, layered, or swirled—is poured to enhance and interact with the wood’s natural figure, filling voids and creating translucent layers with jewel-like depth. The use of vacuum-degassing ensures the epoxy is free of bubbles and achieves a flawless bond with the stabilized wood. Once cured, this hybrid is even stronger than stabilized wood alone, offering added structural integrity while preserving the tactile warmth of genuine timber.</p>
<p>The result is a writing instrument that is not only aesthetically breathtaking but also mechanically robust. Stabilized wood contributes density and resistance to wear, while the epoxy reinforces structural weaknesses and adds rigidity. This makes Spectra Fusion pens capable of withstanding daily handling, environmental changes, and moisture exposure without compromising their visual or functional qualities.</p>
<p>Design-wise, Spectra Fusion retains Conklin’s signature features: the classic cigar-shaped silhouette, engraved cap ring, and crescent-shaped clip that pay homage to the company’s 1898 legacy and iconic Crescent-Filler™ system.</p>
<p>This blue fusion pen - where oceanic blues swirl against golden-orange burl is so unique. Limited to 1,898 pieces per color, each Spectra Fusion pen is presented in a luxury Conklin gift box with a custom sleeve, underscoring its exclusivity and collectability. The collection stands as a testament to Conklin’s commitment to innovation, craftsmanship, and design—where stabilized wood and epoxy resin unite to form pens that are as functional as they are extraordinary. The Spectra Fusion Collection is more than a tool—it is a statement of artistry, engineering, and heritage, offering writers and collectors a unique convergence of nature, science, and legacy.</p>

<p>From Delta:</p>
<p>There is a corner of the soul that belongs only to memories, to those sighs that time has not been able to extinguish. That is where Reginella lives, not just a fountain pen, but a small treasure chest of poetry, created to enclose and revive the enchantment of one of the most poignant Neapolitan songs.<br></p>
<p>A song that smells of nostalgia “Reginella” is a famous Neapolitan song written in 1917 by Libero Bovio, a poet and lyricist among the greatest of the Neapolitan tradition, with music composed by Gaetano Lama.<br></p>
<p>It tells the melancholic confession of a man who meets his lost love after years. With sweet words but full of regret, the protagonist wonders if she too, sometimes, thinks back to those happy days. It is a song of love and nostalgia that has moved anyone who listens to it for over a century, an eternal symbol of the delicacy and intensity of Neapolitan feelings.</p>
<p>The Reginella fountain pen translates this emotion into an object of rare beauty and refinement: The body of the pen is finely engraved with the words of the song's refrain, like a delicate tattoo that preserves the memory of a distant love. On the bottom, an elegant metal band bears the original score engraved: small musical notes dance along the metal, ready to play silently every time you look at them.<br>The nib, in high-quality steel, glides over the paper with the same lightness of a sigh, inviting you to stop your sweetest thoughts.<br></p>
<p>An invitation to write with your heart, with the Reginella pen, every word becomes a dedication, every signature a small serenade. It is a tribute to music, poetry and those heartbeats that sometimes remain only songs whispered in memory.</p>",https://www.gouletpens.com/products/delta-italian-songs-fountain-pen-reginella-special-edition,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/files/Delta-ItalianSongs-Reginella-9-sq_f32c8593-b4c9-4eab-b227-0b9f2b7ea28b.jpg?v=1755031074

<p>Cave paintings represent the earliest known form of artistic communication, to the origins of human creativity. Drawn on the walls of caves thousands of years ago, these images represent hunting scenes, human figures, and animals, capturing the connection between primitives and their world. Each painted line tells stories of survival, spirituality, and a deep bond with nature. Cave art is a testament to the human desire to leave a mark, to convey emotions, and to communicate with the unseen. This fountain pen, inspired by the simplicity and primal strength of cave art, is the essence of humanity’s first artistic expression into its design. Its colors echo the earthy tones of soil and rock, paying tribute to an artistic tradition that paved the way for creative expression across millennia.</p>
<p>This blue/brown/orange fountain pen is accented by silver trim and a matching nib. The stainless steel #6 fountain pen nib is made by the German brand JoWo.

<p><span lang=""EN-US""><span><meta charset=""utf-8"">Medieval art emerged in a deep contrast’s era, where the light of spirituality illuminated a world cloaked in shadows.

Stylized figures, abstract backgrounds, and enigmatic compositions convey a deep sense of devotion and reverent awe. This fountain pen captures the dark and intense tones of the era. Its design echoes the gothic details and profound hues of cathedrals and manuscripts, paying tribute to an art form that left an indelible mark on the folds of <span class=""il"">time</span>.</span></span></p>

<p>At the turn of the 19th century, the artist Alphonse Mucha was at the height of his career. A fine artist, whose name is now synonymous with the art nouveau style, the Czech Mucha came from an illustration background and became widely and commercially well-known through his advertisements for everything from chocolate to cigarettes to laundry detergent. <br><br>Living in Paris, Mucha was also celebrated for his idealized female figures that were often based on Parisian film stars and glitterati, and his work included his years studying, drawing, and painting film actress and icon, Sarah Bernhardt. His portraits of her were printed as large-scale posters heralding his commercial work which took advantage of new advances in printing. <br><br>In 1887, the invention of celluloid film paved the way for Mucha to become the first artist to work directly from photography. Thusly, his color palette was often the rich, warm, pastel tones of photographs and he used these hues to create Mucha women with flowing hair that matched the flourish of his gorgeous lettering and typefaces. <br><br>Within this range of color emerges a signature eau de nil blue that Mucha used to clothe the women in lush drapery, illuminate the skies behind them, give them wings and surround them with waves of water. <br><br>Our newest addition to our core range of Esterbook Estie’s celebrates the innovation of Mucha’s work and his particular shades of blue, blended into a material that reflects the celluloid of pen making past. <br><br>Introducing Nouveau Bleu, the latest offering that joins our other classic colors as a permanent part of the Estie lineup.</p>

<p>“The sea once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.” -Jacques Cousteau <br><br>Timeless takes time.<br>And so it is with the coveted coastal treasures that wash ashore during low tides all over the world, known as sea glass. Shaped over many sunrises and sunsets, these bits of colored glass drift for as many as two hundred years, weathering storms in the salt water, tossing and turning, Mother Nature’s own polishing that gives them their characteristically smooth, frosted texture. <br><br>Prominent in the Northeastern United States, beaches along the shores of New Jersey and New York can be found teeming with these heirlooms and artifacts of whiskey and spirits, trinkets, medicine bottles, dinnerware, jam jars, old taillights and if fortune finds you, a piece of an antique ink bottle. <br><br>First used decoratively at the turn of the last century, beachcombers seek out these little gems giving credence to the statement that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. A bounty of colors ranging from amber to green, black to pale pink and clear frost to the rarest turquoise blue, make sea glass a highly collectible commodity. <br><br>Click to shop all compatible <a href=""https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges"" title=""Short Standard International Ink Cartridges"" target=""_blank"">short</a> or <a href=""https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges"" title=""Long Standard International Ink Cartridges"" target=""_blank"">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",https://www.gouletpens.com/products/esterbrook-estie-fountain-pen-sea-glass-gold,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/files/Esterbrook-Estie-SeaGlass-Gold-OW-2-sq.jpg?v=1755269663

<p>In music, a fantasia is a mixing of styles that create a cohesive piece. It’s a blending of seemingly nonobvious forms that create a symphony that can be appreciated, enjoyed, or even hated. But, it evokes a strong emotion, like all great art. <br><br> And, really, is writing so different? <br><br> Many of us compose our own masterpieces on paper every day. We take from one source and cut, paste, rip, and tear to build something harmonious, seemingly out of nothing. And then, just when it’s about finished, we leave a little blank space to write our own story. And yes, this often evokes strong emotions, too. <br><br> The new Limited Edition Fantasia JR lets you improve and innovate any way you want to the beat of your own drum. <br><br> The “J” was the original Esterbrook’s sleek and suave, classic 1940’s and 50’s pocket pen that appealed to the practicality of the times. It was the perfect pen for both men and women, and we think it still is today. Our new “JR” model, introduced as part of our revival of the Esterbrook brand and added to our core line of collections, is stylish and refined without being too fancy.

The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a matte blue stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib. This is a<span> tribute to the brave Air Force pilots of World War II. This stunning collection commemorates the 80th anniversary of the historic end of World War II, honoring the courage and sacrifice of those who flew into history.</span></p>
<p>Inspired by the shape of the fuselage of the magnificent Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also known as Dakota, which played a pivotal role during World War II, the Monteverde USA® Dakota collection pays homage to the 80th anniversary of the end of this historic conflict on September 2, 1945. The Dakota aircraft was instrumental during crucial moments of the World War II, most notably on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During this pivotal operation, the C-47 Skytrain was vital in executing Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transported thousands of paratroopers, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and delivered essential supplies and equipment to the landing forces.</p>
<p>Ideal for those who appreciate writing instruments that “fly” across every page with ease, the Dakota collection adds satisfaction to every action when in use. Whether you prefer holding the pen by the barrel for comfort or posting it to achieve a full-length writing experience, the Monteverde Dakota is designed to meet your needs. Its pocketable design makes it easy to carry, transforming from a compact pen to a full-sized writing instrument when posted. The Dakota collection is a fitting tribute to the aircraft that soared through history, blending functional elegance with a deep respect for its storied past.</p>
<p>The top of the cap is adorned with an engraved Dakota plane propeller, adding a touch of nostalgia and honoring the legacy of the Dakota plane during this anniversary.</p>
<p>What makes the cap special? The Monteverde Dakota’s innovative SLIP-IN CAP™ is where precision meets function, blending engineering excellence with sensual design to create more than just a pen—it’s an extraordinary experience. Every detail is inspired by the smooth ascent of a plane, allowing the cap to glide effortlessly into place with just a gentle push, delivering an airtight embrace that keeps your ink fresh and ready to flow. This innovative design, unlike traditional screw-on or snap-on mechanisms, offers a seamless blend of functionality and elegance, accentuating the pen’s sleek profile and transforming it into a true companion in your writing journey. Impeccable design and unparalleled performance come together in a luxurious ritual, where every time you close the cap, you're reminded of the power of precision and the beauty of simplicity.</p>
<p>The Dakota features a premium JoWo #5 nib from Germany, renowned for its superior craftsmanship, ink flow, and smooth performance. The nibs are offered in three distinctive point sizes: Extra-Fine, Fine and Medium. JoWo nibs are celebrated for their precision and consistency, providing a luxurious writing experience with every stroke. This high-quality nib enhances the pen’s overall functionality, making it a standout choice.</p>
<p>The fountain pen can easily be filled via standard international short ink cartridges or a full-sized standard international push-in piston converter (included).</p>
<p>The Monteverde Dakota collection pens are elegantly packaged in a luxury gift box with dedicated themed sleeves, making it the perfect gift.

This finish not only absorbs light but also seems to envelop it, creating an impression of infinite depth, much like the vast, uncharted skies that pilots once braved in the Dakota aircraft.</p>
<p>The Black Sky is adorned with gunmetal trim, which enhances its contemporary and slightly edgy character. This combination of deep black and dark metallic tones gives the pen a stealthy, almost futuristic vibe. The Black Sky Dakota is more than just a writing instrument; it’s a statement of elegance and power, a reflection of the boundless potential that lies within the dark unknown.</p>
<p>Inspired by the shape of the fuselage of the magnificent Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also known as Dakota, which played a pivotal role during World War II, the Monteverde USA® Dakota collection pays homage to the 80th anniversary of the end of this historic conflict on September 2, 1945. The Dakota aircraft was instrumental during crucial moments of the World War II, most notably on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During this pivotal operation, the C-47 Skytrain was vital in executing Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transported thousands of paratroopers, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and delivered essential supplies and equipment to the landing forces.</p>

Whether you prefer holding the pen by the barrel for comfort or posting it to achieve a full-length writing experience, the Monteverde Dakota is designed to meet your needs. Its pocketable design makes it easy to carry, transforming from a compact pen to a full-sized writing instrument when posted. The Dakota collection is a fitting tribute to the aircraft that soared through history, blending functional elegance with a deep respect for its storied past.</p>
<p>Starting from the Dakota’s solid stainless steel cap and barrel, to its German-made nib that effortlessly glides across the page, and ending with the satisfying closing action of the slip-in elongated cap, this pen completes every writing session with joy. The top of the cap is adorned with an engraved Dakota plane propeller, adding a touch of nostalgia and honoring the legacy of the Dakota plane during this anniversary.</p>
<p>What makes the cap special? The Monteverde Dakota’s innovative SLIP-IN CAP™ is where precision meets function, blending engineering excellence with sensual design to create more than just a pen—it’s an extraordinary experience. Every detail is inspired by the smooth ascent of a plane, allowing the cap to glide effortlessly into place with just a gentle push, delivering an airtight embrace that keeps your ink fresh and ready to flow. This innovative design, unlike traditional screw-on or snap-on mechanisms, offers a seamless blend of functionality and elegance, accentuating the pen’s sleek profile and transforming it into a true companion in your writing journey. Impeccable design and unparalleled performance come together in a luxurious ritual, where every time you close the cap, you're reminded of the power of precision and the beauty of simplicity.</p>

The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a matte green stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib.</p>
<p>The special color brings a sense of rugged reliability and adventurous spirit to the Dakota collection. The matte green finish is inspired by the tough, no-nonsense appearance of military equipment, embodying a sense of resilience and practicality. This hue echoes the color schemes used on military aircraft during World War II, including the iconic Dakota plane. The green finish is reminiscent of the olive drab paint used to camouflage these aircraft, helping them blend into their surroundings and protect them from enemy fire.</p>
<p>Adding to the historical significance, the Military Green Dakota also pays tribute to the insignia and markings that adorned these planes. The Dakota was often emblazoned with national emblems, unit symbols, and identification numbers, each telling a story of bravery, service, and mission success. This pen captures that spirit, serving as a reminder of the valor and commitment of the soldiers and aircrew who relied on these aircraft during critical moments in history. The chrome trim contrasts beautifully with the matte green, highlighting the pen’s robust character with a sleek, polished accent that emphasizes its military-inspired design.</p>

The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a subtle flame-kissed stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib.</p>
<p>The Raw Flame variant of the Monteverde Dakota is a true masterpiece, achieved through a specialized process of hand-flaming the stainless steel barrel. The metal, when subjected to these high temperatures, creates a unique, one of a kind rainbow effect. As the flame dances across the surface, it produces an extraordinary spectrum of colors that seem to glow from within.</p>
<p>The result is a pen that radiates with an array of iridescent tones, shifting and changing depending on the angle of the light. The colors evoke the intense heat and brilliance of a fire glow, with deep blues, purples, and rich fiery oranges and reds. The process of achieving this finish is incredibly intricate and challenging, requiring a high level of skill and precision. Each Raw Flame pen is unique, as the pattern and distribution of colors are the direct result of the flame’s interaction with the stainless steel, ensuring no two pens are exactly alike.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, minor imperfections can sometimes occur during the hand-flaming, adding even more character and uniqueness to each pen. These slight variations in the finish—whether subtle shifts in color or irregularities in the pattern—are a testament to the handcrafted nature of the pen. Rather than detracting from the overall design, these imperfections contribute to its individuality, ensuring that every Raw Flame Dakota has its own personality, making it impossible to replicate. The pen is finished with chrome trim, which not only complements the hues with its reflective shine but also adds a sleek, modern touch, creating a perfect blend of raw intensity and refined elegance.</p>

<p>A true classic, the Innova™ is one of the first (in a long line of) innovative pens to be designed under the Monteverde USA® name. This Innova is made of Fiberglass, a reinforced plastic material composed of fine glass fibers woven into fabric or used as strands, then combined with resin to create a strong, lightweight, and durable composite. It is widely valued for its strength, versatility, and resistance to environmental factors, making it a popular material across numerous industries.</p>
<p>Advantages of Using Fiberglass in Pens:<br>- Lightweight yet durable – Stronger than plastic while being lighter than metal, offering a balanced feel.<br>- Corrosion-resistant – Unlike metal pens, fiberglass won’t rust or tarnish over time.<br>- Temperature resistant – Doesn’t get too hot or cold like metal pens, making it comfortable for long writing sessions.</p>

<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>

<p>A true classic, the Innova™ is one of the first (in a long line of) innovative pens to be designed under the Monteverde USA® name. This Innova is made of Fiberglass, a reinforced plastic material composed of fine glass fibers woven into fabric or used as strands, then combined with resin to create a strong, lightweight, and durable composite. It is widely valued for its strength, versatility, and resistance to environmental factors, making it a popular material across numerous industries.</p>
<p>Advantages of Using Fiberglass in Pens:<br>- Lightweight yet durable – Stronger than plastic while being lighter than metal, offering a balanced feel.<br>- Corrosion-resistant – Unlike metal pens, fiberglass won’t rust or tarnish over time.<br>- Temperature resistant – Doesn’t get too hot or cold like metal pens, making it comfortable for long writing sessions.</p>
<p>This is a Goulet Pens-exclusive special edition release in the blue color Sapphire! </p>
<p>A stainless steel nib is individually hand-fitted to each fountain pen, intricately cut for maximum performance. Stunning and sleek, each Innova has the perfect flair, whether it is for a formal occasion, business, or casual setting.</p>
<p>The Monteverde Innova fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub, or the JoWo Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.</p>
<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>

No two pens are alike, celebrating both personal expression and shared heritage. This artisan-crafted resin delivers exceptional depth, luminosity, and a refined glossy finish, making every pen a true functional work of art. This handcrafted resin not only delivers exceptional depth and luster but also ensures durability and longevity, making every Innova a collectible heirloom-quality instrument.</p>

You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure.

<p>This blue fountain pen comes with a standard international converter and an ink cartridge. It is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 black steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub or the new JoWo Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width. With six nib options, you are sure to find a selection to fit your handwriting style.</p>
<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>

After much anticipation, this year’s release debuts as the most ambitious and valuable limited edition Emperor ever created under the Namiki name.<br></p>
<p>Inspired by the classical Japanese idiom “百花繚乱” (Hyakka Ryōran), which means “a profusion of flowers in bloom,” the design symbolizes a flourishing of culture, artistry, and individuality. Eleven varieties of flowers from the four seasons of Japan are exquisitely arranged across the Emperor vest-type body, each realized with different maki-e techniques to highlight its unique beauty. Together, these blossoms express not only the richness of nature but also the beauty of a society that celebrates individuality while honoring harmony and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Maki-e, the centuries-old Japanese art of painting with lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder, is at the heart of this pen. Each flower is rendered with a different technique: Hira Maki-e, where designs are painted flat and polished to a smooth finish; Taka Maki-e, which builds raised relief for dimensional detail; Raden, which inlays shimmering fragments of mother-of-pearl; Rankaku, which incorporates the delicate<br>texture of quail eggshell; and Togidashi Maki-e, where layers of lacquer and sprinkled powders are polished back to reveal a luminous, unified surface. Together, these methods create depth, brilliance, and harmony across the full composition.</p>
<p>Spring is represented by Cherry Blossom, Violet, and Wisteria, all delicately rendered in Hira Maki-e (Flat Maki-e). Summer blooms with Clematis and Sweet Lily in Hira Maki-e, while Hydrangea shimmers with a combination of Hira Maki-e and Raden (mother-of-pearl). Autumn brings Dianthus in bold Hira Maki-e, Bellflower enhanced with Raden, and the noble Chrysanthemum, painstakingly depicted in Taka Maki-e (Raised Maki-e). Winter is marked by Plum Blossom, finely detailed in Rankaku (eggshell), and the Winter Peony, given dramatic depth through Taka Maki-e.<br></p>
<p>To unify the composition, the life-giving forces of Earth and Water are expressed with gold, silver, and raden powders in Togidashi Maki-e, creating a luminous background that elevates the vibrancy of the flowers. This layered artistry reflects the philosophy of Hyakka Ryōran: the flourishing of individuality, diversity, and the beauty of coexistence.<br>Crafted by KOKKOKAI artisan Yutaka Sato, each pen is a masterpiece of Japanese lacquer art. Each pen requires an extraordinary amount of time, with every flower applied in layers of lacquer, gold, raden, and eggshell, painstakingly polished between applications. The Emperor body is fitted with Namiki’s signature #50 size 18-karat gold nib, accented with rhodium plating with the iconic image of Mount Fuji. Only 99 pieces will be produced worldwide.</p>

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), and depicts two dragons, one on the cap and one on the barrel. Raden abalone shells accent the background. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.<br><br> Enthralled by the intriguing beauty of the mythical creatures, Namiki beautifully captures the magnificence and quintessence of the Dragon. Fearsome and powerful, dragons are also considered benevolent and the bringers of wealth and good fortune. In Japanese mythology, the dragon is highly-regarded as the Guardian of the East and symbolizes strength, power and protection. It is also known a symbol of fertility, wealth and success.<br><br> There are two types of Japanese dragons; one belonging to the sky while the other is found in bodies of water, and as such is reflected in the cap and body of this pen. The sky dragon depicted on the cap of the fountain pen is seen fiercely guarding the pearl within its three-clawed grasp, believed to be the wish-fulfilling pearl jewel. The magic ball is also known as Cintamani, a sacred stone that gives power and makes its possessor's wishes come true. As the dragon is endowed with supernatural powders, it is also usually linked to water. Thus the dragon in the air uses the Cintamani power to attract rain in the spring and avoid floods in the fall.<br><br> The Taka Maki-e technique helps to accentuate the awesome presence of the two auspicious dragons. Waves and clouds are treated with silver Taka Maki-e creating the perfect contrast with these golden dragons. In the background, the Togidashi and Raden Maki-e techniques are on display, with a black lacquer studded with multicolored glittering abalone shell particles.<br><br> As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting a mythical created called a Kylin.</p>

<p>The Kylin is thought to have a compound appearance with a dragon’s head, antlers, horse hoofs, an oxtail, wolf’s forehead and a colorful chest. It is lively, intelligent and most of all gentle but valorous to ward off devils. To see a Kylin is a good omen that brings rui, roughly translated as ""serenity"" or ""prosperity"" and it is the custom in some regions, to believe that the Kylin will give them a son.</p>
<p>Although it looks fearsome, the Kylin only punishes the wicked. It can walk on grass yet not trample the blades, and it can also walk on water. As it is a peaceful creature, its diet does not include flesh. It takes great care when it walks never to harm or tread on any living thing, and it is said to appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader (some say even if this area is only a house). It is normally gentle but can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a sinner, spouting flames from its mouth and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story.</p>
<p>Legends tell that the Kylin has appeared in the garden of the legendary Huangdi and in the capital of Emperor Yao. Both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It's been told in legends that the birth of the great sage Confucius was foretold by the arrival of a Kylin.</p>

The exquisite hyper-realistic, animal inspired design of the Yukari Royale Frog is brought to life through the thousands of skillful touches of the master artisan.

The tranquil flow of water is expressed with luminous Raden (Mother-of-pearl) and Kawari-nuri. Also among the carefully curated scene are three golden frogs dynamically depicted moving around in a lively manner. Frogs in Japanese, also referred to as “kaeru,” are known to be a popular motif as a lucky charm that will bring health, longevity, protection and wealth. <br><br>Each year, after hibernating, the frog has the peculiarity to go back to the pond of its birth, whatever the distance, for reproduction. Its name in Japanese (kaeru) is pronounced the same way as the word, which means return. This characteristic has made it a protective animal for travelers (often as protective amulets) and the symbol of hospitality. Symbol of fertility, because it lays numerous eggs in one go, the frog is also the one of happy returns of any kind, chance, age, happiness, money, etc. It is also thought to give the power of attracting wealth (it was the emblem of the tax collectors in feudal times).

It features the togidashi-taka maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting beautiful peony flowers and blue butterflies with raden inlaid into the wings. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #20, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink.<br><br>A peony plant produces glorious, stunning, large bloomed flowers and the bark of the plant was first harvested for medicinal use in Japan sometime during 500 BC by Buddhist monks. The magnificent beauty of the flower, however, attracted more attention than the medicinal value. Peonies in full bloom have been depicted around the world in elegant artwork and literature since ancient times. Specifically, in Japan there is a traditional discipline for flowers called Hanakotoba, which is translated to mean the “language using flowers.” Hanakotoba is an unspoken form of communication that uses florals for specific expressions of feelings. Peonies denote bravery, regality, and a distinguished presence. <br><br>This Yukari Royale fountain pen features the taka maki-e technique for both peonies’ blooms and leaves. Dancing around the peonies are beautiful, royal blue butterflies with raden (iridescent, multifaceted Mother-of- Pearl, which makes each pen unique) specially inlaid in the wings. Butterflies are naturally drawn to these flowers. Both the flowers and the butterflies showcased are expressed through togidashi-taka maki-e techniques (burnished-raised design applying a layer of lacquer, sprinkling gold or silver powder and drying with an additional lacquer layer to fix the powder). The background is the traditional black lacquer accentuated with gold powder.<br><br>The Yukari Royale Peony will be a regularly featured item in the Namiki line.

Safety pens are designed to help prevent any ink from leaking while capped. Unlike traditional fountain pens that seal around the grip when closed, the safety pen helps to create a seal right at the ink reservoir. They are not as vulnerable to pressure changes when traveling. They also start right up after periods of non-use due to the fact that the nib and feed stay submerged in ink when retracted. Please note that all Boston Safety pens will now come with a metal core made of surgical stainless steel. </p>
<p>When you first open it, you will notice that the nib is completely retracted into the barrel. To expose the nib, simply push and twist on the back of the pen, keeping the pen in a vertical position with the nib facing up. <b><i>This is important! Otherwise the entirety of the ink supply will pour out of the pen. </i></b>Slowly twist and push all the way up.</p>
<p>To fill this pen, retract the nib fully back into the barrel of the pen, and fill using an eyedropper or an ink syringe with no more than 1ml (to avoid overfilling and spillage).</p>
<p>To close the pen, you will need to retract the nib back into the barrel, keeping it vertical with the nib facing up, before screwing the cap back on.</p>
<p><b><i>We strongly recommend that you watch Nathan’s video below on best practices for using and filling this pen, as it is unlike anything else we carry.</i></b></p>
<p>It uses a #2 flexible nib, the same as the Noodler’s Nib Creaper flex pen.</p>
<p>The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.</p>
<p>As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!</p>
<p>Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use.

Unlike traditional fountain pens that seal around the grip when closed, the safety pen helps to create a seal right at the ink reservoir. They are not as vulnerable to pressure changes when traveling. They also start right up after periods of non-use due to the fact that the nib and feed stay submerged in ink when retracted. Please note that all Boston Safety pens will now come with a metal core made of surgical stainless steel. </p>
<p>When you first open it, you will notice that the nib is completely retracted into the barrel. To expose the nib, simply push and twist on the back of the pen, keeping the pen in a vertical position with the nib facing up. <b><i>This is important! Otherwise the entirety of the ink supply will pour out of the pen. </i></b>Slowly twist and push all the way up.</p>
<p>To fill this pen, retract the nib fully back into the barrel of the pen, and fill using an eyedropper or an ink syringe with no more than 1ml (to avoid overfilling and spillage).</p>
<p>To close the pen, you will need to retract the nib back into the barrel, keeping it vertical with the nib facing up, before screwing the cap back on.</p>
<p><b><i>We strongly recommend that you watch Nathan’s video below on best practices for using and filling this pen, as it is unlike anything else we carry.</i></b></p>
<p>It uses a #2 flexible nib, the same as the Noodler’s Nib Creaper flex pen.</p>
<p>The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.</p>
<p>As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!</p>
<p>Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

With the “Toledo” fountain pen, Pelikan pays tribute to this technique with a love of detail. The new Special Edition Toledo M910 White celebrates this special craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of this edition is the decorative sleeve. Several elaborate steps are necessary to refine the detailed pelican motif on the barrel. The special pelican motif is refined by hand by a goldsmith with many expressive details, so that the very individual expression gives the writing instrument its vibrancy. Two pelican motifs can be seen on the surrounding 925 sterling silver sleeve: a small pelican stands together in front of a pelican with widened wings and the second motif shows a pelican with an open beak. Both motifs are framed by ornaments.</p>
<p>During the manufacturing process, the design is etched onto the sleeve and then the filigree details are stitched by hand. Finally, the surface of the barrel is coated with palladium.</p>
<p>The fountain pen is fitted with a 18k gold nib. <meta charset=""utf-8"">The smooth operating piston mechanism allows you to fill this pen with bottled ink.</p>
<p>Each Toledo writing instrument is unique and handmade in Germany. Each for itself is a great masterpiece - and a little piece of history.

The Custom line was first introduced by Pilot in 1971 to create a range of fountain pens that are truly tailored to the users writing preferences. Each series in the Custom line offers distinctive benefits, ranging from nib sizes to ink reservoir/converters to body style or size. <br><br>The Custom 845 is extremely popular worldwide because of its unique Urushi lacquer finish, two-toned 18k gold nib (size #15) and large ebonite barrel size. A Pilot Con-70 converter is included, but you can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges if you prefer. This exceptional Custom fountain pen is packaged in an elegant gift box. <br><br>Urushi lacquer comes from the sap of the Asian lacquer tree. When applied to the pen barrel, it hardens and absorbs moisture from the air, resulting in a shiny coat. Creating an Urushi lacquer fountain pen is an exacting and complex process because the lacquer must be carefully applied to the pen barrel in numerous hand painted layers.

The Custom line was first introduced by Pilot in 1971 to create a range of fountain pens that are truly tailored to the users writing preferences. Each series in the Custom line offers distinctive benefits, ranging from nib sizes to ink reservoir/converters to body style or size. <br><br>The Custom 845 is extremely popular worldwide because of its unique Urushi lacquer finish, two-toned 18k gold nib (size #15) and large ebonite barrel size. A Pilot Con-70 converter is included, but you can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges if you prefer. This exceptional Custom fountain pen is packaged in an elegant gift box. <br><br>Urushi lacquer comes from the sap of the Asian lacquer tree. When applied to the pen barrel, it hardens and absorbs moisture from the air, resulting in a shiny coat. Creating an Urushi lacquer fountain pen is an exacting and complex process because the lacquer must be carefully applied to the pen barrel in numerous hand painted layers. This traditional Japanese technique ultimately enhances both the pens’ beauty and longevity. Urushi coating will withstand corrosion from water, acids, alcohol, and even temperature changes, making the Custom 845 the perfect pen to use every day and pass down to future generations.</p>

The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs.

We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br>The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br><br> While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this black fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure.

You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter. <i data-stringify-type=""italic"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">There has been a slight change to the Con-70 converter design, so the one you receive may vary from what is pictured here.</i><br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents, which really complement the black color well. <br><br> This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Pilot Sterling fountain pen is handcrafted from genuine sterling silver. Each pen is engraved with an exquisite detailed design, a symbol chosen by Pilot to reflect an important facet of Japanese culture. ""Koushi"" is  a design which depicts a grid-like pattern resembling a door on an old Japanese house.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">This fountain pen features a rhodium-plated 18k gold inlaid nib. A CON-40 converter is included with each pen, but they will also accept Pilot proprietary ink cartridges. </p>

<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The snap cap secures the pen when not in use and although it’s a bit heavy, it will post to make a nicely balanced pen when writing. The overall weight of a pen in the Sterling collection is around 34 grams, making it fairly comparable to the Pilot Metal Falcon. While tarnishing may be a concern given the material of the pen, the included polishing cloth will ensure easy, convenient cleaning of the pen body to keep away blemishes. The design on each pen will not hinder this cleaning either and allows for thorough, complete polishing.</p>",https://www.gouletpens.com/products/pilot-sterling-fountain-pen-silvern-koushi,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pilot-Sterling-Silvern-Koushi-16.jpg?v=1755623227

The Avatar UR marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special magnetic twist cap lock design that provides extra protection.</p>
<p>This matte black fountain pen features a black #6 steel nib engraved with the Pineider logo, and is complemented by black trim. This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.</p>
<p>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</p>
<p>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.</p>
<p>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.</p>
<p>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</p>
<p>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.</p>

The Laurel Green fountain pen conveys Platinum's hope to support you in opening a way to new future and winning glory.</p>

This is <i>""Izumo""</i>, a great influence over the structure of Japan and the heart of its people, thus contributing to the prosperity of the city. <br><br>The word <i>""Izumo""</i>, which expresses the many-layered cloud formations rising vigorously to the sky, had been handed down to the present day. <i>""Izumo""</i> also expresses the idea of progress and creation.<br><br>Based on such an idea, Platinum Pen created a highly original luxury writing instruments brand named <i>""Izumo""</i> with the best intent of expressing the wonderful Japanese traditional art and the quality material, to be passed on to the future generation. The company founder <i>Shunichi Nakata</i> was born in <i>Izumo</i> city, the city in <i>Shimane</i> prefecture in Japan where <i>""IzumoTaisha""</i> Shurine is. The magnificent influence of nature and a mysterious history exist. Derived from such fact, the <i>""Izumo""</i> series was created with the best wishes of obtaining the momentum of clouds rising to the heaven.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional Maki-e, it is applied with silk screen printing instead of urushi lacquer on the underlayer, which is then sprinkled with colored powders such as gold and silver and hand-finished one by one by Maki-e artisans.

These artisanal techniques have been passed down to the present day as traditional crafts.</span></p>

Dupont is renowned worldwide for crafting exceptional writing instruments of superior quality and design. The new ‘Fire-head’ guilloche is no exception and demonstrates one of S.T. Dupont’s oldest and most treasured crafting techniques 'guilloche under lacquer'. S.T. Dupont’s iconic ‘Fire-head’ guilloche pays tribute to the much celebrated ‘Louvre’ museum in Paris, France, famed for its glass ‘pyramid’ entrance, which serves as the design inspiration. <br><br>Guilloche is an intricate decorative technique created by engraving a surface with great precision and then adding a transparent layer of resin, enamel, or in the case of S.T. Dupont’s fine writing instruments, a natural lacquer over the engraved surface. S.T. Dupont engineers engrave a series of ‘pyramids’ throughout the barrel and cap of each pen using an ‘engine turning’ process that engraves very precise and intricate geometric patterns into an underlying material. <br><br>S.T. Dupont's artisans then add layers of natural lacquer to the solid brass engraved pen in a month's long process. Many layers of application and polishing impart depth and mystery to each finish, resulting in a smooth, unique texture on the surface. The engraved guilloche reflects light through the overlay of natural lacquer, creating a spectacular three dimensional display of color. <br><br>The Firehead Guilloche collection is launched on the Line D Large pen; recently remodeled with a new bold blazon on the articulated clip, an enhanced Dupont 'D' in the crown of the cap and a perfectly balanced shape for exceptional writing. The pen cap closes with Dupont's iconic 'cling' and features a fluted grip section for a superb writing experience. This graphite gray colored fountain pen is accented with matte black trim and a black plated 14t gold nib and fills via cartridge/converter (included).<br><br>Each fountain pen receives over 150 handcrafted operations and controls to ensure writing perfection. The fountain pen features S.T. Dupont's famous 'click' to echo their famous lighter 'cling'. <br><br>With the natural lacquer exclusive patina effect, each piece is one of a kind. While the procedure remains the same, the result is always different. Depending on the color contrasts obtained, the handmade production process gives the product its very own depth and soul.</p>

The pen captures this profound aesthetic through its unique construction.</span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> <u></u><u></u><span>The pen is developed and finished by renowned Urushi artist Wayo Shimamori. It features the highly complex Irogasane Sabinuri technique, an intricate application of Urushi lacquer that creates a deep, multi-layered visual texture, reflecting the natural, evolving beauty of the Wabi Sabi concept.</span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>It is crafted from premium Ebonite, providing a unique warmth and feel in the hand that is prized by collectors.</span><u></u><u></u></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The heart of the pen is Sailor's signature, oversized 21K solid gold King of Pen nib, finished with gold plating.</span></p>
<p>Urushi lacquer is made of sap from trees grown only in East Asian countries that take 15 years to reach maturity. After years of patience and care, the sap is then harvested and mixed into lacquer, hand applied to the ebonite pen surface, and kept in high humidity until it sets into a lustrous finish that is waterproof and extraordinarily durable. <br><br>This fountain pen comes with a Sailor proprietary converter, a proprietary Sailor ink cartridge, a pen sleeve, and a cleaning cloth. It is limited to 20 pieces worldwide. </p>
<p><em>Note: the Wabi Sabi pens are not designed to have the cap posted; this is to protect the Sabinuri Urushi lacquer.</em></p>

<p>The 1911L Themis is finished in a beautiful gray color that radiates a modern, casual feel while maintaining a refined look. The pen features a well-balanced, black IP-finished metal grip section that enhances the writing experience by providing a satisfying weight and allowing for smoother strokes without the need for excessive pressure, making it ideal for extended writing sessions. Additionally, this model showcases Sailor’s unique 21K solid gold nib, finished with black IP.</p>
<p>This model is aptly named ""Themis"" after the Greek goddess known as the personification of law, order, and justice. In Greek mythology, Themis is a symbol of fairness, balance, and rightful counsel, often depicted holding scales and a sword to represent impartiality and truth. Her presence symbolizes the timeless pursuit of justice—a fitting inspiration for this pen, which has been thoughtfully designed with legal professionals and students of law in mind.</p>
<p>The name ""Themis"" reflects Sailor’s commitment to providing tools that support those who champion justice, emphasizing the pen’s practicality, elegance, and thoughtful construction. Like the goddess herself, the 1911L Themis brings balance to its user, offering stability, control, and a writing experience that stands up to the demands of a professional environment.</p>
<p>The Sailor 1911 Large fountain pen comes equipped with Sailor's legendary black ion 21k gold nib in several nib sizes.

As with other models in this annually released series, the body's design is inspired by a masterpiece of traditional Japanese art, expressed with colored ebonite. This year's model is Sailor's interpretation of ""Plum Estate in Kameido"" by Hiroshige Utagawa as published in the ""One Hundred Famous Views of Edo"". Regarded highly by the world, as evident in Vincent van Gogh's reproduction ""Flowering Plum Tree"", they brought the image to life with UMESAKI.<br></p>
<p>Plum Estate in Kameido was a plum orchard situated behind Kameido Tenjin Shrine, that became famous for ""Garyubai"", meaning a plum tree shaped like a sleeping dragon. It was a hugely popular sightseeing spot in spring, even known to be cherished by Yoshimune Tokugawa, the 8th Shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The portrayal of sightseers enjoying the view from beyond the fence is testimony to the estate's popularity. Depicting closer objects as close-ups and farther objects in smaller size was Hiroshige's preferred composition. He also succeeded in giving the tree a convincing woody texture by layering paint.</p>
<p>Engraved with a serial number, each piece is unique. <meta charset=""utf-8""><meta charset=""utf-8"">UMESAKI is a limited edition of only 500 pieces worldwide, made available only through authorized Sailor Bespoke dealers. Each pen is individually numbered.</p>
<p>UMESAKI comes in a new dark brown wooden gift box in the image of plum wood, different from packaging for past models of this series. The inside is lined with exquisitely elegant crape fabric, a reproduction of traditional ""Chirimen"" that has been cherished in Japan since ancient times, and adorned with sleeves in color inspired by dainty plum blossoms. The inside is lined with an exquisitely elegant crape, Chirimen, fabric, a reproduction of a traditional material that has existed in Japan since ancient times.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">This special Naginata Togi nib allows you to write with a thin line when holding the pen vertically upright, or with a thicker line when holding the pen at a lower writing angle. In this way it’s similar to a Sailor Zoom nib. It also is ground so that it writes thicker on the cross stroke and thinner on the down stroke, like an Architect nib. It’s really a blend of Zoom and Architect, which is quite unique and not available from any other pen manufacturer.</p>

The Anni60 black resin body is complemented by ultra black PVD-plated trim, and fills with a built-in piston mechanism. It is fitted with an in-house made nib in 14k gold Flexible sizes with an ebonite feed. Each pen comes with a matching pen sleeve made of genuine leather and cotton.</p>
<p>The SCRIBO FEEL Anni60 fountain pen is made in a limited quantity of 219.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the dandy style made a comeback, fueled by a rebellious youth culture and a fashion revolution that broke away from established conventions. A new generation embraced elegance as a form of individual expression. Rejecting conformity, this generation reimagined the elegant dandy style of the 19th century with a bold mix of sophistication and theatrical flair.</p>
<p>Attention to detail became an act of rebellion, and with appearance treated as an expression of art, the dandy style was a challenge to established norms. The dandy became a modern icon of defiance, straddling tradition and revolution, a walking symbol of an era where fashion was much more than just style: it was identity, loud and unapologetic.</p>
<p>In the spirit of 1960s dandy style, the FEEL Anni60 captures this same rebellious elegance. Through the art of the Guilloché technique, mastered by the Italian company Renzetti, FEEL Anni60 revolutionizes the balance between tradition and innovation.</p>
<p>The Anni’ 60 pattern, so refined and with a vintage flavor, adorns the FEEL Anni60 and was used for a long time in high jewelry and watchmaking. The design replicates the effect of antique lace and has recently returned to prominence with applications in various fields, especially in design and high fashion, with surprising results. For the first time, it is featured on a writing instrument made of resin.</p>
<p>The artistic Guilloché engraving is done entirely by hand and is still operated exclusively mechanically today. It is an ancient art achieved by tracing one line at a time with various tools, creating a harmonious design on metal, resin, and wood surfaces. Its earliest record dates back to the year 1624, found engraved on some vintage watch cases featuring this craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Only a few companies in the world master and preserve the true artisanal Guilloché method, making every engraved object even more precious and unique thanks to the skilled hand of the artisan. The company Renzetti1909, with its expertise, SCRIBO's partner for this exclusive collection, represents one of the leading exponents of this ancient craft.</p>
<p>As in the best tradition of hand writing instruments, every stylistic detail of the FEEL has been conceived, designed and manufactured to create a unique fountain pen that stands out in the search for the best writing experience.</p>
<p>The body of the pen, which slips into the shape of the Doric column, is turned by hand from a solid bar. The cap, the barrel and the knob, characterized by a slight entasis that enhances the shape, describe a statuesque object with a neo-classical, elegant and timeless design.</p>
<p>Even the nib-holder, before tapering to the classic circular section, is finished with a hint of facet that facilitates the handle and allows you to better manage the angle which you want to use the nib with.</p>
<p>The nib of the FEEL, the SCRIBO cornerstone, is the real protagonist of this writing instrument. The 14-carat gold Flexible nib is the same nib used by Omas and that is for SCRIBO the first brick to start again a brand-new story of Italian creativity.</p>
<p>The perfect match for this historic nib is undoubtedly the ebonite feeder, which enhances the always ready, generous, soft and precise writing, thanks to the use of the classic piston filling system.</p>
<p>The SCRIBO FEEL is accompanied by a genuine leather and cotton handmade soft pouch realized to protect two writing instruments. In the side pocket there is a cloth to keep your fountain pens clean. A precious and modern packaging to always carry with you your favourite writing instruments.</p>
<p>FEEL is an invitation to live a unique writing experience of the highest quality; it is an exhortation to seek everyone’s own writing style, it is a tribute to the aesthetics of handwriting and the pleasure of writing.</p>
<p>FEEL. Feel the writing.<br><br>About SCRIBO:</p>
<p>SCRIBO, short for <i>Scrittura Bolognese</i>, was founded by former employees of the retired OMAS brand. Fundamental values include writing tradition, design, craftsmanship, and made in Italy.

<p>The Neptune Fountain is one of the most famous monuments in Bologna and it was built in the 16th century to celebrate the power of the city. The famous fountain has been given an affectionate and ironic nickname in the dialect of Bologna by the Bolognese people, “Al Zigant” (the Giant), and it is meant to emphasize its size and impact on the city. This nickname is due to the large size of the statue, which is 3.2 meters tall and weighs 28 tons.</p>

<p>A few dozen kilometers from Bologna, in the hills separating Emilia-Romagna from Tuscany, we find the Labante Caves, one of the most impressive travertine formations in Italy, with a length of 54 meters and a drop of about 15 meters.<br></p>
<p>The caves were created by the erosive action of spring water that, over millennia, has created a fairy-tale and evocative landscape where you can admire stalactites, stalagmites, flows and pools. In addition to their geological value, the Labante Caves are located in an area of great scenic beauty, and their dark and silent environment is capable of creating an evocative and fascinating atmosphere.<br></p>
<p>The travertine that makes them up is a sedimentary limestone that is widespread in Emilia-Romagna and in Bologna itself. In fact, travertine has been used since Roman times for the construction of numerous historic buildings in our city including, the Two Towers and the incomplete Basilica of San Petronio facade that dominates Piazza Maggiore in the city center.</p>

Palladium-finished details shine like thin lines of distant galaxies, tracing a secret map between the sky and the page.<br></p>

Two pens inspired by the elements that make up our planet, fire and air, each limited to 388 pieces worldwide.</span></p>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">The four elements come together in this collection to remind us of the origins of our planet. Earth, wind, fire, and water interacting to form the materials of our existence. Inspired by the mythical and primordial forces that shaped our planet and ignited the very spark of human existence, this collection embodies the essence of timeless energy and boundless inspiration.</span></p>
<p><meta charset=""utf-8""><span data-mce-fragment=""1""><span><meta charset=""utf-8"">Windy grey hues and dark blue tones interweave with a vibrant iridescent teal bringing life to the ""Air"" edition. These natural resins are mixed and swirled creating images of a hazy, stormy sky. Each pen is accented by silver trim to compliment the cool resin tones. The clip is filled with a bright, iridescent teal - an element that ties back to the Earth and Water editions of the Earth Origins collection.</span></span></p>
<p>The Homo Sapiens features a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel. This revolutionary closing system is very satisfying to operate and was created to lock the pen body into the cap to prevent the possibility of the pen accidentally unscrewing and leaking inside a pocket or bag.</p>
<p>It comes with Visconti's 18kt gold in-house nib hand-crafted and manufactured in Florence, Italy. Available in EF, F, M, and B.</p>

<p>While the first edition celebrated golden reflections immersed in forged carbon, this new creation pushes the boundaries of research even further, transforming matter into a perfect expression of strength and lightness without neglecting elegance.</p>
<p>To achieve extreme lightness, every metal component has been reimagined: the titanium of the first Carbon Moiré gives way to Ergal, a special aluminum-based alloy used in aerospace engineering, renowned for its exceptional mechanical strength. The result is a perfect balance between solidity and writing comfort.</p>
<p>The carbon itself has also evolved: thanks to even more sophisticated manufacturing techniques, the fibers are denser, creating a stronger and more uniform surface. But it is the introduction of anodized blue aluminum alloy foil that radically transforms the model’s aesthetics. Among the carbon veins, iridescent reflections emerge, evoking the depth of a nocturnal ocean.</p>
<p>In harmony with these chromatic vibrations, all Ergal metal parts undergo a deep-blue anodization process. This finish not only enhances resistance to corrosion and scratches but also gives the product a unique stylistic identity. On the clip, the Visconti logo is highlighted with a delicate laser engraving, revealing the natural color of the underlying metal and creating an elegant contrast.</p>
<p>The double reservoir power filler is a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel. It also features a magnetic snap cap. </p>
<p>Finally, the fountain pen is completed with an in-house made ruthenium plated 18k gold nib. This Limited Edition is individually numbered and limited to 288 pens worldwide. Each pen is presented in a beautifully crafted limited-edition box.</p>

This is more than a writing instrument - it is a statement of craftsmanship, revealing the hidden beauty of its inner workings.</span></p>
<p><span><meta charset=""utf-8"">Born from the union of the distinctive Homo Sapiens design and the allure of demonstrator pens, this edition lays bare the heart of the pen: every internal component has been reimagined to become part of the visual experience. The seals, internal fittings, and even the spring of the bayonet closure are tinged in deep blue, contrasting elegantly with gold-plated metal parts, polished to a mirror finish and engraved with exquisite precision. Completing the design, the external bronze rings recall the legacy of the legendary Lava Bronze.</span></p>
<p><span><meta charset=""utf-8"">Crowning this masterpiece is the debut of a new skeletonized nib in 14kt gold, inspired by the art of filigree. Its openwork structure reveals glimpses of the blue feed beneath and offers a uniquely flexible writing experience, capable of adapting line width to the pressure of the hand. Thanks to a re-engineered bayonet system, the nib remains visible even when the pen is closed - its presence, unmistakable. In a world that often favors surface over substance, Visconti chooses to reveal what truly matters: quality, ingenuity, and authentic beauty.</span></p>
<p>But true innovation lies in the way each detail has been executed. Traditional threads have been replaced by micro-screws, ensuring perfect transparency and an immaculate finish even within the pen's most concealed sections. Every component has been treated as if it were on display - because here it is.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><span>The Homo Sapiens Full Demo is more than a pen - it is a declaration of style and truth. It is limited to 1,088 pieces worldwide and is numbered out of 1,088 on the finial. The words ""Full Demo"" are on the cap, opposite of the clip. <u></u></span></p>

This collection is a tribute to the beauty and elegance of the irises that bloom between the end of April and the end of May in the historic Florentine garden, located near the Piazzale Michelangelo and offers a stunning view of the city.</p>
<p>The history of the so-called ""lily"" of Florence is controversial. It seems that it originated from a white iris, the Iris Florentina, which grew abundantly in the Arno Valley during the Florentine Republic which the people called ""ghiacciolo"" or ""icicle"" for its white, slightly bluish color.</p>
<p>The iris is not only a symbol of Florence, but also of its rich history and culture. The lily was adapted as the emblem of the city in the 11th century, when it was used to decorate the banners and shields of the Florentine soldiers. The lily also represents wisdom, courage and faith, qualities that have characterized Florence throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>Like previous limited collections in the Homo Sapiens series, Iris Garden is made from special, semi-transparent demo resins carefully selected by Visconti's designers. The highlight of the collection, however, is the rose gold trims that perfectly match the coloring of the resin and add a touch of light and exquisite detail to the design.</p>

<p>The lotus flower is recognized by many cultures as a symbol of strength, purity and rebirth. Its spiritual meaning comes to mind as we envisage this beautiful flower, submerged every night in river water, miraculously re-blooming the next morning sparklingly clean. The power of creation is in its DNA, just as it is in ours: Homo Sapiens, the Wise Human.</p>
<p>For the return of the iconic Homo Sapiens, Visconti has imagined the colors of the lotus garden, the fascinating environment which is home to the delicate flowers of the aquatic plant Nelumbo. Swirls of lilac, green and white resin combine throughout the pen, accentuated by black trim, which recalls the flower’s reflection in dark pond water, adding to its mystery. Each element harmonizes perfectly, creating an elegant and modern collection that invites you to get close to nature and enjoy its incredible power.</p>

Both resins were selected for their color saturation and mystifying swirling. The Fire Opal is dusted with gold flecks to add to the luminescence of the orange resin and give a kaleidoscope effect. It is complemented by gold vermeil trim and a 14k gold nib.</p>
<p>The resin for each pen was made by Jonathon in the USA, and then sent to Italy where it was hand turned at Visconti’s Florentine factory into their iconic 'Kaleido' pen model. A classic Visconti pen that is impeccably designed and weighted offering the perfect everyday writing experience.</p>

The Medici collection has been redesigned and draws on the best of Visconti's historical heritage and DNA, enriching it with valuable new features such as a new demonstrator central ring, made with the skeletonization technique, which features the official emblem of Florence, the lily. This symbol, found on the city's coat of arms, represents beauty, nobility and pride. As a fundamental element of Florentine culture and tradition since the Middle Ages, it has been represented in paintings by numerous Florentine artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti as a link between Florence and artistic beauty.</p>
<p>Inspired by the geometry of the Florence Baptistry, the pen's shape was designed following the principles of the golden ratio. The central ring is just one example of the enhancements made to this historical collection, which is a part of Visconti's heritage. The loading system now features a capacious power-filler double reservoir and the clip, which was previously laser-engraved, has been replaced with a new enameled version.</p>
<p>The pen is made of Acrosilk, an innovative material first introduced by Visconti, which consists of a compound of acrylic resin and silk fibers. For a more contemporary look, this special acrylic blend has been sandblasted to achieve a fine satin finish giving the look of finished wood grain.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">This pen features briarwood-colored resin and gold-plated trim. It also has Visconti's 18kt gold in-house gold nib, available in EF, F, M, and B. It's completed with Double Reservoir Power Filler and a Hook Safe Lock.<br></p>

The classic ‘squaring the circle’ shape, a luxurious matte gold finish with detailed engravings and an abundance of innovation. <br><br> The name of the collection, 'Opera' is shown on the front of the ring to enhance the link between Visconti and the city of Florence. The design elements on the remaining sides of the ring include a typical Florentine decoration with four loops inspired by the bronze tiles by Brunelleschi and Ghiberti on the north door of the Baptistery of Santa Maria del Fiore, with the addition of the Visconti “V” from the logo. <br><br> As always, Visconti excels at creating uniquely swirled resins, this time in 3 classic colors. The Opera Gold collection is available in blue, red and black infused with gold marbling. Matte finish gold plated trim completes the elegant design of this classic Visconti pen design featuring a large yellow gold plated stainless steel nib. <br><br> The fountain pen fills using Visconti's patented double reservoir power filler and features a second ink window around the ring of the pen behind the nib. The fountain pen and rollerball versions also feature Visconti's patented hook-safe lock closure and the fountain pen features a newly designed piston rod. <br><br> The fountain pen features Visconti's new, popular large steel nib plated in yellow gold. The nib features Visconti's iconic engraved details.</p>

Van Gogh painted with three shades of yellow ‘and nothing else’. In doing so, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color without any loss of eloquence. <br><br> The Visconti ‘Sunflowers’ fountain pen is made from natural resin, brought to life by vibrant yellow hues expressing a special significance for Van Gogh: ‘gratitude’. The meticulous selection of resins and their color mix is one of the major innovations introduced by Visconti and makes each and every Visconti Van Gogh pen unique. The colors are further enhanced by the unique 18 faceted design of the Van Gogh Collection. <br><br> Just like other painters working at the time, Van Gogh created floral themed still-life paintings, but he did things a little differently, experimented with color. After practicing with different flowers, he chose a specific variety: the sunflower. Thinking that these flowers were somewhat coarse and unrefined, Van Gogh gave sunflowers the lead role in several paintings. <br><br> Van Gogh knew that his sunflower paintings were special, as did other people. After he died, friends brought sunflowers with them to his funeral. Sunflowers became synonymous with Van Gogh, just as he had hoped. <br><br> Each fountain pen nib is made from steel and engraved with Van Gogh's signature. A converter is included with each pen, and the fountain pen is presented in a gift box with a bookmark and a bottle of Visconti 'sunny yellow' ink to match the pen. It also accepts standard international short cartridges.</p>

<p>Blue and yellow, a touch of black. These are not only the main colors of the painting, but also the feelings that we perceive. Looking at the artist's works, impressions become colored, chromatic combinations stir up emotions that find no other name except the name of the color itself. Blue and yellow come to life; they are no longer complements but become the true, compelling subject of the work. This combination of pigments arouses beautiful feelings, which is what Visconti has in mind as they design pens that pay tribute to this great painter of the 1900's.</p>
