For centuries, they lived in harmony, each guarding a sacred element of the natural world.</p>\n<p><strong>Dubh\u00e1nach (doo-VAH-nahk):\u00a0</strong>The Black Dragon. Guardian of the night, Dubh\u00e1nach was born from the shadows of the moonless sky. Cloaked in obsidian scales, every breath brought the stillness of the night. His eyes blazed like embers in the dark, and he was said to control the mysteries of the unknown\u2014whispers carried by the wind, secrets hidden in the stars. His fearsome power came from his connection to the dark forces of the world, and many believed that only the bravest could unlock his dark gifts. Dubh\u00e1nach\u2019s mighty flames, depicted in the fiery red and orange details of the pen, represent the fire of destruction and transformation, burning away the old to make way for new wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>Glas\u00f3g (GLA-sog):\u00a0</strong>The Green Dragon. Born from the heart of ancient forests, Glas\u00f3g was the protector of life itself. His emerald and sapphire scales shimmered with the vitality of the earth, and his glowing orange eyes pierced through the shadows of the wild. Known as the Bringer of Growth, Glas\u00f3g\u2019s fiery breath could set the world ablaze, but from the ashes, new life would always emerge. Legend has it that Glas\u00f3g\u2019s power kept nature in balance\u2014forests would grow where his flames touched, and rivers would flow in his wake. The golden flames rising from the base of this pen are a symbol of his dominion over fire, regeneration, and the eternal cycle of life.</p>\n<p>But the peace between the two dragons could not last forever. As their realms began to overlap, the tension between Dubh\u00e1nach's control of the dark and Glas\u00f3g's mastery over nature grew. The skies above their land turned to fire as the two dragons clashed, their epic battle said to have shaken the very foundation of the world. Though their war raged for centuries, legend has it that their final breaths were captured in these pens, immortalizing their power for all who dared to wield them.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>Please note: the Fine, Medium, and Broad steel nibs offered on this pen are a #6 Schmidt nib and housing.

    "description": "<p>Introducing the BENU Pixie Fountain Pen Set! Each set comes with three Pixie pens, the cutest little fountain pen you've ever seen. Compact in size, yet comfortable to write with when the cap is posted, this pen is a true marvel in the world of pocket-sized fountain pens. The three fountain pens come in extra-fine, fine, or medium - with all three pens in the set having the same size nib.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Magenta Madness introduces energetic shades of fuchsia, hot pink, and electric berry into the Pixie line. Each design combines saturated color with sparkling accents that fade into lighter, light- catching tones. The overall effect is bold, lively, and eye-catching. Each pen has a silver or gold Schmidt #5 stainless steel nib, and the clipless screw-cap pushes to post. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Extensively tested before its launch, the Pixie strikes the balance between petite aesthetics and ergonomics, ensuring it is suitable for long writing sessions despite its compact size.</p>\n<p>It comes with a blue standard international short ink cartridge. You can also fill the whole barrel with ink to use as an eyedropper pen with a larger ink capacity. A mini standard international converter (such as the Kaweco foldable converter) is available for purchase separately.<br></p>\n<p><i>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same. We cannot honor special requests.</i></p>",

This collection is inspired by great legends and the mystical beliefs that surround talismans, amulets, and other magical items used to bring luck, protection, money, love or special abilities. <br><br>Whether you are an avid believer in the magical power of plants, stones, herbs, and crystals, or you remain skeptical to this mysterious and unknown world, there indeed lies a sprinkling of curiosity and intrigue within each of us. Believer or not, we can all admire the fabulous myths and ancient beliefs behind these good luck charms. <br><br>We invite you to step into this hypnotizing realm of folklore and see for yourself if there is any truth to be found beneath the fables. Who knows, perhaps this fascinating magic might make its way into our modern world! <br><br>This Talisman collection is made complete with 5 pens, each named after a special substance: Mandrake, Dragon\u2019s Blood, Peacock Ore, Fox Gloves, and Edelweiss. Drawing inspiration from certain tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by actually infusing a part of each substance into the five different designs. <br><br> Known historically as <em>Sanguis Draconis</em>, Dragon\u2019s Blood has been used in magic rituals and alchemy for centuries. Ancient traders obtained it from small islands, where the dragons were believed to dwell. However, the magical blood wasn\u2019t yielded directly from the dragons, but from a genus of curious trees - the most famous species in horticulture was named <em>Dracaena Draco</em>, otherwise known as the Dragon Tree. The bright red resin that is obtained from <em>Dracaena Draco</em> is surrounded by many ancient myths and legends, one of which is the thrilling tale of the battle between Hercules and Ladon: <br><br>As the Ancient Greek Legend has it, Ladon, a serpent-like dragon, was sent by Hera, the Queen of Heaven, to protect the sacred fruit that she had gifted to Zeus. The hotheaded Hercules was sent on the dangerous task of stealing the Hesperides apples, with the fierce dragon on-guard close by. Against all odds, the mighty Hercules slayed the ferocious Ladon, and the dragon\u2019s blood spilled out over the land, sprouting \u2018dragon\u2019 trees. These Dragon Trees, with their long, slender trunks and prickly leaves, continue to bleed the death of Ladon with an oozing, reddish sap whenever cut. <br><br>In old Europe, Dragon\u2019s Blood became a vital component in the alchemical arts and the concocting of magical potions. During the Middle Ages it was used to make healing potions or to mark armor invulnerable and weapons unbreakable.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

However, this non-toxic, noble plant, with its snow-white leaves and star-shaped inflorescence, is often associated with certain myths related to proving one\u2019s worth and discovering true love.<br><br> One fable tells the tragedy of a hauntingly beautiful queen with a heart of pure ice. Stories of her beauty reached many doomed suitors, who dared to proclaim love for the queen. Since her frozen heart was unable to love, she soon tired of them and ordered her loyal goblins to throw the hapless men to their deaths. One day, an ordinary shepherd found his way to her cave and the queen fell in love with him. The jealous goblins, fearing their mistress would marry this mortal and abandon them, threw him into the abyss. When she learned of the tragedy, her heart melted enough for her to shed a solitary tear. That tear became the first Edelweiss.<br><br> Although this tragic tale earned Edelweiss its popular name \u201cThe Tear of the Snow Queen\u201d, another legend, told by Berthold Auerbach in 1861 in his book, <em>Edelweiss</em>, made the flower a true symbol of eternal love. The tale tells the story of a young man who risks his life to collect rare Edelweiss flowers for his lover as proof of his daring and brave nature.<br><br> With all the mystique surrounding the Edelweiss flower, these tales and fables might not be easy to chew. Accurate or not, this small, potent plant continues to be used in medicine as a remedy against many diseases. Its origins, however, are up to you to decide...</p>\n<p><br><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>This BENU Talisman fountain pen features a turquoise and fuchsia resin base with holographic sparkles throughout. The pen glows in the dark\u00a0in a vivid green color after an hour of exposure to light. It has a silver Schmidt #6 stainless steel nib, a black resin grip and accents, a silver clip, and pushes to post. It comes with a standard international converter and one long blue ink cartridge. You can also fill the whole barrel with ink to use as an eyedropper pen with a massive ink capacity.</p>\n<p>BENU is proud to introduce its marvelous new collection of pens, Talisman. This collection is inspired by great legends and the mystical beliefs that surround talismans, amulets, and other magical items used to bring luck, protection, money, love or special abilities. <br><br>Whether you are an avid believer in the magical power of plants, stones, herbs, and crystals, or you remain skeptical to this mysterious and unknown world, there indeed lies a sprinkling of curiosity and intrigue within each of us. Believe it or not, we can all admire the fabulous myths and ancient beliefs behind these good luck charms. <br><br>We invite you to step into this hypnotizing realm of folklore and see for yourself if there is any truth to be found beneath the fables. Who knows, perhaps this fascinating magic might make its way into our modern world! <br><br>This Talisman collection is made complete with 5 pens, each named after a special substance: Mandrake, Dragon\u2019s Blood, Peacock Ore, Fox Gloves, and Edelweiss. Drawing inspiration from certain tales of yore, we set out to convey these stories not only in the color and style of each pen, but by actually infusing a part of each substance into the five different designs. <br><br>The mandrake root is native to both the Mediterranean and the Himalayas. With a long history of use in religious and occult practices, this plant is particularly noted for its potent roots, which somewhat resemble the human body.<br><br> One of the earliest mentions of mandrake can be dated back to the Bible. In Genesis 30, Rachel, Jacob\u2019s wife, relies on this special plant to help her conceive a child. With its sweet fragrance that acts as an aphrodisiac, the mention of mandrakes in the Song of Solomon is part of a romantic encounter between Solomon and his new wife. It is suggested that the scripture links the mandrake with sexuality and fertility.<br><br> In the Middle Ages, folk understood that plants bearing resemblances to body parts could be used to treat their associated limbs and organs. Mandrakes can look rather like babies, so those having trouble conceiving would sleep with them under their pillows. And it wasn\u2019t just about mandrakes getting people \u201cin the mood\u201d and fertile! According to Anthony John Carter, as he writes in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2003, medieval folk carried mandrake roots around as good luck charms, hoping the plant would grant them not only wealth and the power to control their destiny, but also the ability to control the destinies of others as well.<br><br> Having a long history of medicinal and magical use - from witches brew to modern medicine - this fantastic plant is still fundamentally part of our lives and certainly continues to work its magic in our modern day society.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>This Conklin 1898 fountain pen is a Goulet exclusive, limited production, featuring a dark blue, teal, and orange resin made by Jonathon Brooks of the Carolina Pen Company. It features a new clip and a trimless cap.</p>\n<p>Conklin 1898 is inspired by the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, designed with comfort and durability in mind. This collection is suited to individuals looking for a well-sized, cigar shaped pen that provides a larger surface area for a comfortable grip while writing. </p>\n<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, or 1.1mm stub, as well as the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width. Each Cushion Point nib displays the brand name and is marked with special crescent-shaped breathing holes. The Conklin quality control team tests each nib individually to ensure top quality writing performance.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p>The 1898 fountain pen comes with reliable standard international cartridges as well as a threaded converter. Each Conklin brand writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift box. Conklin 1898 collection is an ideal gift for any person in your life or for yourself, whether it\u2019s used in their professional lives, home offices, or daily journaling.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>This Conklin 1898 fountain pen is a Goulet exclusive, limited edition of only 100 pens, featuring a green, blue, and brown resin made by Jonathon Brooks. Each pen is individually numbered.</p>\n<p>Conklin 1898 is inspired by the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, designed with comfort and durability in mind. This collection is suited to individuals looking for a well-sized, cigar shaped pen that provides a larger surface area for a comfortable grip while writing. </p>\n<p>All writing instruments feature a cap ring with a Conklin original vintage pattern, initially used on the first self-filling pens produced by the company back in 1898. The ring also features the year the legendary Conklin pen company was founded by Roy Conklin in Toledo, Ohio. Together, these elements pay homage to the vintage Conklin era and its extraordinary legacy in the world of writing instruments. Lastly, each pen features Conklin\u2019s distinctive \u201crocker style\u201d clips, designed for a smooth clip-on action.</p>\n<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 rose gold-plated steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, or 1.1mm stub, as well as the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width. Each Cushion Point nib displays the brand name and is marked with special crescent-shaped breathing holes. The Conklin quality control team tests each nib individually to ensure top quality writing performance.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p>The 1898 fountain pen comes with reliable standard international cartridges as well as a threaded converter. Each Conklin brand writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift box. Conklin 1898 collection is an ideal gift for any person in your life or for yourself, whether it\u2019s used in their professional lives, home offices, or daily journaling.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>This Conklin 1898 fountain pen features the Primary Manipulation 5.0 resin from Jonathon Brooks at the Carolina Pen Company. The red, brown, and blue resin has a shiny finish with gold trim and a 14k gold nib.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Conklin 1898 is inspired by the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, designed with comfort and durability in mind. This collection is suited to individuals looking for a well-sized, cigar shaped pen that provides a larger surface area for a comfortable grip while writing.</p>\n<p>All writing instruments feature a cap ring with a Conklin original vintage pattern, initially used on the first self-filling pens produced by the company back in 1898. Together, these elements pay homage to the vintage Conklin era and its extraordinary legacy in the world of writing instruments.</p>\n<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made two-tone JoWo 14k gold nib in fine or medium, as well as the Omniflex flexible gold nib for variation in line width. Each nib displays the brand name and is marked with special crescent-shaped breathing holes. The Conklin quality control team tests each nib individually to ensure top quality writing performance.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p>The 1898 fountain pen comes with reliable standard international cartridges as well as a threaded converter. Each Conklin brand writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift box. Conklin 1898 collection is an ideal gift for any person in your life or for yourself, whether it\u2019s used in their professional lives, home offices, or daily journaling.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>The Conklin\u00ae 1898 Spectra Fusion Collection represents a masterful blend of traditional craftsmanship and cutting-edge materials science\u2014where the beauty of nature meets modern engineering. At the heart of this collection lies stabilized wood, a specially treated wood infused with epoxy to significantly enhance its durability, aesthetic appeal, and workability. Through a meticulous process involving drying, vacuum pressure infusion, and curing, the stabilizing agent deeply penetrates the wood fibers, filling pores and voids. Once hardened, the epoxy transforms the wood into a medium that resists warping, cracking, and moisture, while showcasing a smooth, polished finish. This process not only preserves the natural grain and color but also elevates them, making stabilized wood ideal for applications requiring both beauty and strength\u2014such as luxury pen making.</p>\n<p>Each Spectra Fusion pen begins with professionally stabilized maple burl, chosen for its intricate grain patterns and unique character. The stabilization process results in a wood that is hard, dense, and resistant to environmental stresses. On its own, this stabilized burl would already be suitable for precision work and detailed carving, capable of holding fine edges and showcasing vibrant hues.</p>\n<p>However, the Spectra Fusion Collection takes innovation a step further by fusing the stabilized wood with hand-poured epoxy resin. This fusion creates a hybrid material that is both structurally superior and visually dynamic. The epoxy\u2014pigmented, layered, or swirled\u2014is poured to enhance and interact with the wood\u2019s natural figure, filling voids and creating translucent layers with jewel-like depth. The use of vacuum-degassing ensures the epoxy is free of bubbles and achieves a flawless bond with the stabilized wood. Once cured, this hybrid is even stronger than stabilized wood alone, offering added structural integrity while preserving the tactile warmth of genuine timber.</p>\n<p>The result is a writing instrument that is not only aesthetically breathtaking but also mechanically robust. Stabilized wood contributes density and resistance to wear, while the epoxy reinforces structural weaknesses and adds rigidity. This makes Spectra Fusion pens capable of withstanding daily handling, environmental changes, and moisture exposure without compromising their visual or functional qualities.</p>\n<p>Design-wise, Spectra Fusion retains Conklin\u2019s signature features: the classic cigar-shaped silhouette, engraved cap ring, and crescent-shaped clip that pay homage to the company\u2019s 1898 legacy and iconic Crescent-Filler\u2122 system.</p>\n<p>This blue fusion pen - where oceanic blues swirl against golden-orange burl is so unique. Limited to 1,898 pieces per color, each Spectra Fusion pen is presented in a luxury Conklin gift box with a custom sleeve, underscoring its exclusivity and collectability. The collection stands as a testament to Conklin\u2019s commitment to innovation, craftsmanship, and design\u2014where stabilized wood and epoxy resin unite to form pens that are as functional as they are extraordinary. The Spectra Fusion Collection is more than a tool\u2014it is a statement of artistry, engineering, and heritage, offering writers and collectors a unique convergence of nature, science, and legacy.</p>\n<p>Conklin 1898 is inspired by the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, designed with comfort and durability in mind. This collection is suited to individuals looking for a well-sized, cigar shaped pen that provides a larger surface area for a comfortable grip while writing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, or 1.1mm stub, as well as the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.

    "description": "<p>This Conklin 1898 fountain pen is a Goulet exclusive, special edition of only 100 pens, featuring a shimmering purple and turquoise resin made by Jonathon Brooks of the Carolina Pen Company. This 1898 features a new clip and a trimless cap design.</p>\n<p>Conklin 1898 is inspired by the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, designed with comfort and durability in mind. This collection is suited to individuals looking for a well-sized, cigar shaped pen that provides a larger surface area for a comfortable grip while writing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Conklin 1898 fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, or 1.1mm stub, as well as the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width. Each nib displays the brand name and is marked with special crescent-shaped breathing holes. The Conklin quality control team tests each nib individually to ensure top quality writing performance.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p>The 1898 fountain pen comes with reliable standard international cartridges as well as a threaded converter. Each Conklin brand writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift box. Conklin 1898 collection is an ideal gift for any person in your life or for yourself, whether it\u2019s used in their professional lives, home offices, or daily journaling.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. <br><br>The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.<br><br>During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The \"All American\" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.<br><br>The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a \"Toledo, Ohio\" engraving on its nib and barrel.

    "description": "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The new CANOVA fountain pen from Delta is inspired by the Italian sculptor and architect Antonio Canova, who lived from 1757-1822 and was regarded as one of the greatest Neoclassical artists. His work is the inspiration for this pen, in particular his famous sculpture <em> <i>Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss </i></em>(shown on the sleeve of the box), which is hailed as an important sculpture ushering in the Romantic period. The CANOVA pen has a stunning dark green resin body with very fine engraved lines down the barrel and swirled ivory body and cap finials. The spring-tension clip has a unique gold feathery wing design representing Cupid's wing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>This fountain pen includes a threaded standard international converter, has gold-plated trim, and a gold-plated #6 JoWo steel nib. Each pen is handmade in Delta's factory in Naples, Italy.<br></p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">This special edition is only available at Goulet Pens, and each one is individually numbered with a 3-digit number. Included with each pen is a 30ml glass bottle of Delta green ink.\u00a0</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some slight variation in the pattern seen here on the white portions of the pen. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same. We cannot honor special requests.</em></p>",

That is where Reginella lives, not just a fountain pen, but a small treasure chest of poetry, created to enclose and revive the enchantment of one of the most poignant Neapolitan songs.<br></p>\n<p>A song that smells of nostalgia \u201cReginella\u201d is a famous Neapolitan song written in 1917 by Libero Bovio, a poet and lyricist among the greatest of the Neapolitan tradition, with music composed by Gaetano Lama.<br></p>\n<p>It tells the melancholic confession of a man who meets his lost love after years. With sweet words but full of regret, the protagonist wonders if she too, sometimes, thinks back to those happy days. It is a song of love and nostalgia that has moved anyone who listens to it for over a century, an eternal symbol of the delicacy and intensity of Neapolitan feelings.</p>\n<p>The Reginella fountain pen translates this emotion into an object of rare beauty and refinement: The body of the pen is finely engraved with the words of the song's refrain, like a delicate tattoo that preserves the memory of a distant love. On the bottom, an elegant metal band bears the original score engraved: small musical notes dance along the metal, ready to play silently every time you look at them.<br>The nib, in high-quality steel, glides over the paper with the same lightness of a sigh, inviting you to stop your sweetest thoughts.<br></p>\n<p>An invitation to write with your heart, with the Reginella pen, every word becomes a dedication, every signature a small serenade. It is a tribute to music, poetry and those heartbeats that sometimes remain only songs whispered in memory.</p>",

The feeder is made of ebonite the same color as the pen and produced in house with the same attention to detail, a perfect balance between functionality and aesthetics. Ebonite, chosen for its excellent conduction properties and durability, adds a touch of sophistication and durability, ensuring that your fountain pen is not just a writing instrument, but a life companion.</p>\n<p>Perfect for collectors and handwriting enthusiasts, this fountain pen is more than just a writing instrument: it is a symbol of refinement and personal style. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Each Prestige fountain pen comes with a complementary bottle of black ink.<br><br>Each pen is handmade in Naples, Italy.

Crafted from a hand-turned translucent resin barrel, each pen is an individual work of art, carefully polished inside and out to ensure crystal clarity and a flawless finish. This meticulous workmanship not only enhances the beauty of the resin, but also offers a fascinating view of the internal mechanism, a fixed piston made in house, transforming each writing into a visual as well as tactile experience.</p>\n<p>The heart of this fountain pen is its writing unit: the large number #8 nib in 14-carat gold accompanied by a special feeder, number #8, an essential component to guarantee a constant and precise ink flow. The feeder is made of ebonite the same color as the pen and produced in house with the same attention to detail, a perfect balance between functionality and aesthetics. Ebonite, chosen for its excellent conduction properties and durability, adds a touch of sophistication and durability, ensuring that your fountain pen is not just a writing instrument, but a life companion.</p>\n<p>Perfect for collectors and handwriting enthusiasts, this fountain pen is more than just a writing instrument: it is a symbol of refinement and personal style. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Each Prestige Matte fountain pen comes with a complementary bottle of black ink.<br><br>Each pen is handmade in Naples, Italy.

The Delta Signs of Time collection of twelve fountain pens masterfully pays tribute, through design details and materials, to the most important artistic movements that have influenced global culture. This collection is a bridge between the tradition of art and a passion for elegance.</p>\n<p>Cave paintings represent the earliest known form of artistic communication, to the origins of human creativity. Drawn on the walls of caves thousands of years ago, these images represent hunting scenes, human figures, and animals, capturing the connection between primitives and their world. Each painted line tells stories of survival, spirituality, and a deep bond with nature. Cave art is a testament to the human desire to leave a mark, to convey emotions, and to communicate with the unseen. This fountain pen, inspired by the simplicity and primal strength of cave art, is the essence of humanity\u2019s first artistic expression into its design. Its colors echo the earthy tones of soil and rock, paying tribute to an artistic tradition that paved the way for creative expression across millennia.</p>\n<p>This blue/brown/orange fountain pen is accented by silver trim and a matching nib. The stainless steel #6 fountain pen nib is made by the German brand JoWo. In addition to several standard nib sizes, there is also a flex nib variant that allows you to alter the line thickness by varying the pressure applied to the nib. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">It fills via cartridge or converter (one is included), allowing you to use bottled ink.</p>\n<p>Delta, the renowned Italian pen brand that has been creating stunning and distinct pens since the 1980s, has made a triumphant return after it ceased operations in the 2010s.

    "description": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">We celebrate the power of art through time. The Delta Signs of Time collection of twelve fountain pens masterfully pays tribute, through design details and materials, to the most important artistic movements that have influenced global culture. This collection is a bridge between the tradition of art and a passion for elegance.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <span>The Renaissance marks a\u00a0</span><span class=\"il\">time</span><span> of extraordinary transformation, where man returns to the center of the universe and art becomes the voice of a new vision of the world. Drawing inspiration from classical antiquity but with an innovative drive, Renaissance artists celebrate beauty, knowledge, and harmony, creating masterpieces that blend science and poetry.Perspective revolutionizes pictorial space, bringing depth and realism to compositions, while intricate details become tools to exalt nature and the perfection of the human form. Renaissance art tells the story of an aspiration for earthly perfection, always intertwined with a spiritual dimension, elevating the everyday to a symbol of eternity. This fountain pen embodies the elegance and grace of an era that defined the standards of art and culture. Tones reminds of frescoes and the works of the great masters; each stroke is a tribute to the creative genius that changed the course of history.</span></span></p>\n<p>This grey and gold resin fountain pen is accented by gold trim and a matching nib. The stainless steel #6 fountain pen nib is made by the German brand JoWo. In addition to several standard nib sizes, there is also a flex nib variant that allows you to alter the line thickness by varying the pressure applied to the nib. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">It fills via cartridge or converter (one is included), allowing you to use bottled ink.</p>\n<p>Delta, the renowned Italian pen brand that has been creating stunning and distinct pens since the 1980s, has made a triumphant return after it ceased operations in the 2010s. This new Delta brand has been personally revitalized by Nino Marino, one of Delta's co-founders who also owns and manages Maiora and Nettuno pen brands. Each pen is handmade in Naples, Italy, and is individually numbered.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>Note: We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same. We cannot honor special requests.</em></p>",

It features a smooth writing #6 JoWo silver stainless steel nib, a matte black grip and trim, and fills via standard international cartridge/converter (both are included).</p>\n<p>From Diplomat: Unlike other models in the Aero range, the Aero Funky features a smooth surface, offering an exceptional grip and fluidity. But its true distinction lies in its double surface treatment: PVD + Niobium.<br>\u00a0<br>Niobium is a rare metal often used in jewelry and the aerospace industry for its ability to create unique color effects. Combined with PVD treatment, it gives the Aero Funky a stunning finish with ever-changing reflections of violet, blue, green, depending on the light and viewing angle. A truly unique and mesmerizing result.<br></p>\n<p>The Aero Funky is only being produced once, so quantities are very limited and it is a true special edition!

    "description": "<p>The Esterbrook\u00a0Bestie\u00a0Collection\u00a0celebrates friendship, fun, and a shared love of pinks and purples through two joyful fountain pens: Bubble Gum Pink and Sugar Plum Purple.</p>\n<p>Bubble Gum Pink is a rich blend of deep pinks, fuchsia, and soft whites, lively and,expressive without being overpowering. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">The balance and weight are familiar and comfortable for long writing sessions,\u00a0journaling, or everyday use.</p>\n<p>Each bestie pen is housed in a playful drawer-style box. Inside, you'll discover a soft, furry \"bed\" for your Bestie, adding an extra layer of charm and collectability to your unboxing experience. It's whimsical, cozy, and perfectly on theme.</p>\n<p>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>\n<p>This flecked pink resin fountain pen has gold trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JoWo German gold-plated steel nib.</p>\n<p>A sleek clip provides a clean accent for the cap and slides easily into a shirt pocket. A cushion cap closure provides a secondary seal to ensure a wet point. Finally, the fountain pen is equipped with a gold #6 JoWo steel nib in a range of sizes. The Estie fills via standard international cartridge or converter (included).</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>The Esterbrook Bestie Collection celebrates friendship, fun, and a shared love of pinks and purples through two joyful fountain pens: Bubble Gum Pink and Sugar Plum Purple.</p>\n<p>Sugar Plum Purple leans into a dark, grape-like purple accented with white flecks, giving it depth, contrast and just the right amount of whimsy. The balance and weight are familiar and comfortable for long writing sessions, journaling, or everyday use.</p>\n<p>Each bestie pen is housed in a playful drawer-style box. Inside, you'll discover a soft, furry \"bed\" for your Bestie, adding an extra layer of charm and collectability to your unboxing experience. It's whimsical, cozy, and perfectly on theme.</p>\n<p>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>\n<p>This flecked purple resin fountain pen has gold trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JoWo German gold-plated steel nib.</p>\n<p>A sleek clip provides a clean accent for the cap and slides easily into a shirt pocket. A cushion cap closure provides a secondary seal to ensure a wet point. Finally, the fountain pen is equipped with a gold #6 JoWo steel nib in a range of sizes. The Estie fills via standard international cartridge or converter (included).</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

A fine artist, whose name is now synonymous with the art nouveau style, the Czech Mucha came from an illustration background and became widely and commercially well-known through his advertisements for everything from chocolate to cigarettes to laundry detergent. <br><br>Living in Paris, Mucha was also celebrated for his idealized female figures that were often based on Parisian film stars and glitterati, and his work included his years studying, drawing, and painting film actress and icon, Sarah Bernhardt. His portraits of her were printed as large-scale posters heralding his commercial work which took advantage of new advances in printing. <br><br>In 1887, the invention of celluloid film paved the way for Mucha to become the first artist to work directly from photography. Thusly, his color palette was often the rich, warm, pastel tones of photographs and he used these hues to create Mucha women with flowing hair that matched the flourish of his gorgeous lettering and typefaces. <br><br>Within this range of color emerges a signature eau de nil blue that Mucha used to clothe the women in lush drapery, illuminate the skies behind them, give them wings and surround them with waves of water. <br><br>Our newest addition to our core range of Esterbook Estie\u2019s celebrates the innovation of Mucha\u2019s work and his particular shades of blue, blended into a material that reflects the celluloid of pen making past. <br><br>Introducing Nouveau Bleu, the latest offering that joins our other classic colors as a permanent part of the Estie lineup.</p>\n<p>Click to shop all compatible <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">short</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ravens have long held an almost mystical fascination in the human psyche. From Edgar Allen Poe to Norse mythology, depictions of ravens have long interested our storytelling.</p>\n<p>Because of this history, Esterbrook was inspired to create a pen that has all of the subtle, mysterious charm of the intelligent and curious corvid. Introducing the Estie Raven. With its matte black body and matching nib and trim, this pen is a departure from our regular colorway -- but no less exciting.</p>\n<p>This comfortably balanced Estie Raven, part of the regular lineup, is offered in a fountain pen with black trim. A sleek clip provides a clean accent for the cap and slides easily into a shirt pocket. A cushion cap closure provides a secondary seal to ensure a wet point. Finally, the fountain pen is equipped with a black #6 JoWo steel nib. Most exciting of this release is the button piston mechanism for the Raven release. With a simple press, you can fill your pen for an easy, mess-free experience. This is the latest in a suite of new innovations from the brand and we are excited to debut it with the Raven!</p>",

    "description": "<p>\ufeffThis limited edition, sparkling translucent blue resin pocket-sized fountain pen is the Esterbrook JR, short for \"J Reborn\". A modern take on a vintage classic, it is complemented by gold-plated trim. It fills via standard international cartridge/converter (included) and has a gold-plated JoWo #5 stainless steel nib.</p>\n<p><em>From Esterbrook:</em></p>\n<p>In music, a fantasia is a mixing of styles that create a cohesive piece. It\u2019s a blending of seemingly nonobvious forms that create a symphony that can be appreciated, enjoyed, or even hated. But, it evokes a strong emotion, like all great art. <br><br> And, really, is writing so different? <br><br> Many of us compose our own masterpieces on paper every day. We take from one source and cut, paste, rip, and tear to build something harmonious, seemingly out of nothing. And then, just when it\u2019s about finished, we leave a little blank space to write our own story. And yes, this often evokes strong emotions, too. <br><br> The new Limited Edition Fantasia JR lets you improve and innovate any way you want to the beat of your own drum. <br><br> The \u201cJ\u201d was the original Esterbrook\u2019s sleek and suave, classic 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s pocket pen that appealed to the practicality of the times. It was the perfect pen for both men and women, and we think it still is today. Our new \u201cJR\u201d model, introduced as part of our revival of the Esterbrook brand and added to our core line of collections, is stylish and refined without being too fancy. It\u2019s meant to match your style, as nicely as it graces your hand. With an elegant design, that isn\u2019t fussy, it is compact in size, so you can always have one on hand and with you on the go, wherever you go. <br><br> Both the German JoWo nib and the top of the pen have been engraved with the Esterbrook Eternity symbol.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Esterbrook is thrilled to release their latest collaboration with BUNGUBOX Japan: the Kachofugetsu Kingfisher Fountain Pen\u2014a celebration of beauty, nature, and the art of writing.</p>\n<p>In Japanese, Kachofugetsu (\u82b1\u9ce5\u98a8\u6708)\u2014Flower, Bird, Wind, and Moon\u2014is a timeless expression honoring the natural world and its seasonal rhythms. Each release in this series is inspired by one of these elements and designed in collaboration with Kaoru Yamagishi, founder of BUNGUBOX, one of Japan\u2019s most beloved pen boutiques.\u00a0The new Kingfisher Edition pays tribute to the vibrant bird known for its jewel-like feathers and graceful flight along riversides.</p>\n<p>Crafted in the U.S. from DiamondCast resin, the body of the pen features a stunning interplay of deep teal, warm copper, and soft black\u2014mirroring the iridescent elegance of the kingfisher in motion. Gold-plated trim and a matching converter complete the design, along with a special gold-plated nib engraved with the Japanese character for \u201cbird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every detail of this collection has been thoughtfully considered for to bring the ethos of this limited edition collection to life.</p>\n<p>With a #6 JoWo German gold-plated steel nib and Esterbrook\u2019s renowned cushioned inner cap system, this pen promises a smooth writing experience. The Estie fills via standard international cartridge or converter (included).</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of this unique material, there will be\u00a0<b>variation </b></i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">in the patterns and colors seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same. We cannot honor special requests.</i></p>",

    "description": "<p>Founded in 1858 in Camden, NJ, Esterbrook became one of America\u2019s leading pen makers, trusted by presidents, educators, artists, and everyday writers. Our pens were staples in schools, offices, and studios, known for their quality and accessibility. Revived in the 21st century, Esterbrook now combines its heritage with modern design. The Peanuts collaboration connects two cultural icons and marks the start of a long-term partnership, with new accessories and products beyond pens.</p>\n<p>Charles M. Schulz, the creator of Peanuts, used Esterbrook pens exclusively to bring his beloved characters to life. From the very first sketches, these pens were the tools that shaped Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and the rest of the Peanuts world. Both Esterbrook and Peanuts share deep roots in mid-century American culture, embodying creativity, optimism, and timeless storytelling that still resonate today.</p>\n<p>This Esterbrook X Peanuts 75th Anniversary Edition Fountain Pen - Snoopy is a special edition black and white that comes with \u00a0a #6 JoWo German gold-plated steel nib, engraved with \"Good Grief!\" on the nib. The pen comes with a mini t-shirt (which is a polishing cloth), a converter, and an ink cartridge. Additional items pictured are sold separately.\u00a0</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>Click to shop all compatible </span><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a><span>\u00a0standard international ink cartridges.</span></p>",

This limited edition Model 31 style fountain pen features a stunning custom blended resin named Bound Horizon. The resin has swirls of red, purple, and cream, with large glitter sparkles throughout. The design is unique in every pen and no two are exactly alike. The resin is made by Jennifer Early of Stormwind's Blanks.</p>\n<p>A limited number of pens are available.</p>\n<p>The Model 31 pen has a screw-cap to open/close and pushes to post, and has a silver clip. It comes with a standard international converter and fits both short and long standard international cartridges. You can also convert it to eyedropper fill.\u00a0It is completed with a smooth-writing #6 JoWo nib in a variety of size offerings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here. We\u2019re unable to honor any preferential pattern requests at this time.</em></p>\n<p>Click to shop all compatible <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">short</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

This limited edition Model 31 style fountain pen features a stunning custom blended resin named Fabalone Abalone. The resin has swirls of blue, black, and pink. The design is unique in every pen and no two are exactly alike. The resin is made by Turnt Pen Co.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A limited number of pens are available.</p>\n<p>The Model 31 pen has a screw-cap to open/close and pushes to post, and has a silver clip. It comes with a standard international converter and fits both short and long standard international cartridges. You can also convert it to eyedropper fill.\u00a0It is completed with a smooth-writing #6 JoWo nib in a variety of size offerings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here. We\u2019re unable to honor any preferential pattern requests at this time.</em></p>\n<p>Click to shop all compatible <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">short</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

The fountain pen's weight and length can be adjusted to meet the individual needs of its user. The minimalistic design is reminiscent of Bauhaus and Braun.</p>\n<p>This fountain pen is made entirely out of brass. Brass will become tarnished when in use and develop an individual patina over time. The well-known ECO brass (brass manufactured by the Wieland Werke in Ulm) is lead-free.</p>\n<p>It comes with a larger #6 stainless steel nib and an ink cartridge to get you started writing right away! The cap screws on to the back to post securely, and it accepts short standard international cartridges. Standard international converter is available separately.\u00a0The pen comes packaged in a tin box.<br><br>Click to shop all compatible <a title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">short</a> or <a title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

The twist-action fountain pen is then ready to write. When the fountain pen is twisted closed, a ball valve automatically moves in front of the opening and protects the retracted nib from drying out and getting dirty.</p>\n<p>The dialog cc features a roll stop, in lieu of a clip, creating a minimalistic look. It is slightly shorter than the dialog 3, and features rose gold-plated trim.</p>\n<p>This matte dark blue lacquered fountain pen comes with a smooth interchangeable two-tone 14K rose gold nib. It comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge as well as a proprietary Z27 converter to get you started writing right away. It is set in a gift box with a leather pen slip.<br><br> <b>Note: </b>To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing.

    "description": "<p>In partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products (WBDGCP), LAMY is launching a licensed collection\u2013Harry Potter x LAMY safari. With a total of four models, the collection will inspire all writing enthusiasts and creative fans.</p>\n<p>The design of the four models is inspired by the four houses of the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Each fountain pen features the unmistakable color scheme of the houses.</p>\n<p>This set includes all 4 Harry Potter collection fountain pens - Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Ravenclaw!</p>\n<p><b></b>The LAMY <span>safari</span> is a workhorse pen, known throughout the fountain pen community for its ruggedness, reliability, and no-nonsense functionality. The triangular grip makes it great for those starting out who have no idea how to hold a fountain pen, but it's used and loved by fountain pen lovers of all levels of experience.</p>\n<p>The <span>safari</span> comes with an interchangeable black steel nib, which can be easily swapped out for another size. This fountain pen comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter. <br><br><b>Note: </b>To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/lamy-ink-cartridges\" title=\"LAMY Ink Cartridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible LAMY ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em>The personal views or opinions by the author of the Harry Potter book series do not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of The Goulet Pen Company or its team members.</em></p>",

    "description": "<p>The new Maiora Everest \u2013 The Majesty of Writing!<br></p>\n<p>Overcoming limits is in human nature. Everest, born in the Maiora workshops, is not just a fountain pen: it is a feat of engineering and craftsmanship; it is the first \u201cgiant\u201d fountain pen in the world that adopts a fixed piston, innovative in terms of its generous dimensions, called \u201cMega Piston\u201d, designed to guarantee unprecedented ink capacity and an uninterrupted writing experience: 5ml ink.</p>\n<p>Each example is born from entirely artisanal workmanship: precious and embellished materials, hand turned from solid bar; Everest is the result of great technical commitment, precision and dedication, combining elegance and technique in an imposing and exclusive form.</p>\n<p>Like the mountain from which it takes its name, Everest rises above all other fountain pens, embodying the pinnacle of creativity and craftsmanship.<br></p>\n<p>This fountain pen is made entirely of blue, black and tan ebonite hand-turned from a solid bar and mirror polished. The pen comes with a 14k #8 gold nib with an ebonite feed. Each pen is numbered on the base of the cap, and handmade in Italy.

    "description": "<p>The Monteverde Dakota fountain pen is compact when closed, but a full-sized pen when posted. The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a matte blue stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib. This is a<span>\u00a0tribute to the brave Air Force pilots of World War II. This stunning collection commemorates the 80th anniversary of the historic end of World War II, honoring the courage and sacrifice of those who flew into history.</span></p>\n<p>Inspired by the shape of the fuselage of the magnificent Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also known as Dakota, which played a pivotal role during World War II, the Monteverde USA\u00ae Dakota collection pays homage to the 80th anniversary of the end of this historic conflict on September 2, 1945. The Dakota aircraft was instrumental during crucial moments of the World War II, most notably on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During this pivotal operation, the C-47 Skytrain was vital in executing Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transported thousands of paratroopers, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and delivered essential supplies and equipment to the landing forces.</p>\n<p>Ideal for those who appreciate writing instruments that \u201cfly\u201d across every page with ease, the Dakota collection adds satisfaction to every action when in use. Whether you prefer holding the pen by the barrel for comfort or posting it to achieve a full-length writing experience, the Monteverde Dakota is designed to meet your needs. Its pocketable design makes it easy to carry, transforming from a compact pen to a full-sized writing instrument when posted. The Dakota collection is a fitting tribute to the aircraft that soared through history, blending functional elegance with a deep respect for its storied past.</p>\n<p>The top of the cap is adorned with an engraved Dakota plane propeller, adding a touch of nostalgia and honoring the legacy of the Dakota plane during this anniversary.</p>\n<p>What makes the cap special? The Monteverde Dakota\u2019s innovative SLIP-IN CAP\u2122 is where precision meets function, blending engineering excellence with sensual design to create more than just a pen\u2014it\u2019s an extraordinary experience.

    "description": "<p>The Monteverde Dakota fountain pen is compact when closed, but a full-sized pen when posted. The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a black stainless steel barrel and cap, with gunmetal trim and a silver JoWo #5 steel nib.</p>\n<p>The Black Sky color option is steeped in mystery and depth, capturing the essence of a starless night. The rich, velvety black finish has an almost tactile quality, drawing you in with its smooth and sophisticated appearance. This finish not only absorbs light but also seems to envelop it, creating an impression of infinite depth, much like the vast, uncharted skies that pilots once braved in the Dakota aircraft.</p>\n<p>The Black Sky is adorned with gunmetal trim, which enhances its contemporary and slightly edgy character. This combination of deep black and dark metallic tones gives the pen a stealthy, almost futuristic vibe. The Black Sky Dakota is more than just a writing instrument; it\u2019s a statement of elegance and power, a reflection of the boundless potential that lies within the dark unknown.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the shape of the fuselage of the magnificent Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also known as Dakota, which played a pivotal role during World War II, the Monteverde USA\u00ae Dakota collection pays homage to the 80th anniversary of the end of this historic conflict on September 2, 1945. The Dakota aircraft was instrumental during crucial moments of the World War II, most notably on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During this pivotal operation, the C-47 Skytrain was vital in executing Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transported thousands of paratroopers, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and delivered essential supplies and equipment to the landing forces.</p>\n<p>Ideal for those who appreciate writing instruments that \u201cfly\u201d across every page with ease, the Dakota collection adds satisfaction to every action when in use. Whether you prefer holding the pen by the barrel for comfort or posting it to achieve a full-length writing experience, the Monteverde Dakota is designed to meet your needs. Its pocketable design makes it easy to carry, transforming from a compact pen to a full-sized writing instrument when posted. The Dakota collection is a fitting tribute to the aircraft that soared through history, blending functional elegance with a deep respect for its storied past.</p>\n<p>Starting from the Dakota\u2019s solid stainless steel cap and barrel, to its German-made nib that effortlessly glides across the page, and ending with the satisfying closing action of the slip-in elongated cap, this pen completes every writing session with joy. The top of the cap is adorned with an engraved Dakota plane propeller, adding a touch of nostalgia and honoring the legacy of the Dakota plane during this anniversary.</p>\n<p>What makes the cap special? The Monteverde Dakota\u2019s innovative SLIP-IN CAP\u2122 is where precision meets function, blending engineering excellence with sensual design to create more than just a pen\u2014it\u2019s an extraordinary experience.

    "description": "<p>The Monteverde Dakota fountain pen is compact when closed, but a full-sized pen when posted. The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a matte green stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib.</p>\n<p>The special color brings a sense of rugged reliability and adventurous spirit to the Dakota collection. The matte green finish is inspired by the tough, no-nonsense appearance of military equipment, embodying a sense of resilience and practicality.

The green finish is reminiscent of the olive drab paint used to camouflage these aircraft, helping them blend into their surroundings and protect them from enemy fire.</p>\n<p>Adding to the historical significance, the Military Green Dakota also pays tribute to the insignia and markings that adorned these planes. The Dakota was often emblazoned with national emblems, unit symbols, and identification numbers, each telling a story of bravery, service, and mission success. This pen captures that spirit, serving as a reminder of the valor and commitment of the soldiers and aircrew who relied on these aircraft during critical moments in history.

    "description": "<p>The Monteverde Dakota fountain pen is compact when closed, but a full-sized pen when posted. The Slip-In cap has an oh-so-satisfying feel. This fountain pen features a subtle flame-kissed stainless steel barrel and cap, with silver trim and a JoWo #5 steel nib.</p>\n<p>The Raw Flame variant of the Monteverde Dakota is a true masterpiece, achieved through a specialized process of hand-flaming the stainless steel barrel. The metal, when subjected to these high temperatures, creates a unique, one of a kind rainbow effect. As the flame dances across the surface, it produces an extraordinary spectrum of colors that seem to glow from within.</p>\n<p>The result is a pen that radiates with an array of iridescent tones, shifting and changing depending on the angle of the light. The colors evoke the intense heat and brilliance of a fire glow, with deep blues, purples, and rich fiery oranges and reds. The process of achieving this finish is incredibly intricate and challenging, requiring a high level of skill and precision. Each Raw Flame pen is unique, as the pattern and distribution of colors are the direct result of the flame\u2019s interaction with the stainless steel, ensuring no two pens are exactly alike.</p>\n<p>Due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, minor imperfections can sometimes occur during the hand-flaming, adding even more character and uniqueness to each pen. These slight variations in the finish\u2014whether subtle shifts in color or irregularities in the pattern\u2014are a testament to the handcrafted nature of the pen. Rather than detracting from the overall design, these imperfections contribute to its individuality, ensuring that every Raw Flame Dakota has its own personality, making it impossible to replicate. The pen is finished with chrome trim, which not only complements the hues with its reflective shine but also adds a sleek, modern touch, creating a perfect blend of raw intensity and refined elegance.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the shape of the fuselage of the magnificent Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also known as Dakota, which played a pivotal role during World War II, the Monteverde USA\u00ae Dakota collection pays homage to the 80th anniversary of the end of this historic conflict on September 2, 1945. The Dakota aircraft was instrumental during crucial moments of the World War II, most notably on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During this pivotal operation, the C-47 Skytrain was vital in executing Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transported thousands of paratroopers, including the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, and delivered essential supplies and equipment to the landing forces.</p>\n<p>Ideal for those who appreciate writing instruments that \u201cfly\u201d across every page with ease, the Dakota collection adds satisfaction to every action when in use. Whether you prefer holding the pen by the barrel for comfort or posting it to achieve a full-length writing experience, the Monteverde Dakota is designed to meet your needs. Its pocketable design makes it easy to carry, transforming from a compact pen to a full-sized writing instrument when posted. The Dakota collection is a fitting tribute to the aircraft that soared through history, blending functional elegance with a deep respect for its storied past.</p>\n<p>Starting from the Dakota\u2019s solid stainless steel cap and barrel, to its German-made nib that effortlessly glides across the page, and ending with the satisfying closing action of the slip-in elongated cap, this pen completes every writing session with joy. The top of the cap is adorned with an engraved Dakota plane propeller, adding a touch of nostalgia and honoring the legacy of the Dakota plane during this anniversary.</p>\n<p>What makes the cap special? The Monteverde Dakota\u2019s innovative SLIP-IN CAP\u2122 is where precision meets function, blending engineering excellence with sensual design to create more than just a pen\u2014it\u2019s an extraordinary experience.

This Innova is made of Fiberglass, a reinforced plastic material composed of fine glass fibers woven into fabric or used as strands, then combined with resin to create a strong, lightweight, and durable composite. It is widely valued for its strength, versatility, and resistance to environmental factors, making it a popular material across numerous industries.</p>\n<p>Advantages of Using Fiberglass in Pens:<br>- Lightweight yet durable \u2013 Stronger than plastic while being lighter than metal, offering a balanced feel.<br>- Corrosion-resistant \u2013 Unlike metal pens, fiberglass won\u2019t rust or tarnish over time.<br>- Temperature resistant \u2013 Doesn\u2019t get too hot or cold like metal pens, making it comfortable for long writing sessions.</p>\n<p>This is a Goulet Pens-exclusive special edition release in the color amethyst!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A stainless steel nib is individually hand-fitted to each fountain pen, intricately cut for maximum performance. Stunning and sleek, each Innova has the perfect flair, whether it is for a formal occasion, business, or casual setting.</p>\n<p>The Monteverde Innova fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 silver steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub, or the\u00a0JoWo Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p>It fills via standard international converter or ink cartridge, both of which are included.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible short standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

Inspired by a commitment to crafting exceptional writing instruments, this collection reflects a harmonious blend of innovation and elegance. Each pen embodies the brand\u2019s passion for quality and precision, offering a seamless writing experience.</p>\n<p>What sets the Innova Titanium collection apart is its ability to deliver luxury and performance at an accessible price point. By combining advanced materials like TA2 grade titanium and carbon fiber with precision engineering, Monteverde ensures that high-end craftsmanship is within reach for a wider audience. This commitment to luxury affordability makes the collection a standout choice for those who value both style and substance in their writing instruments.</p>\n<p>Every Monteverde Innova Titanium fountain pen is crafted with meticulous attention to detail, highlighting its solid titanium body and precision-machined construction. A standout feature is the matte finish, which not only provides a smooth feel but also enhances durability. The slim design and balanced weight ensure comfort during extended writing sessions, minimizing hand fatigue.</p>\n<p>A distinctive carbon fiber mid-ring enhances the pen\u2019s design with its contemporary, high-tech appeal. Known for its exceptional strength and lightweight properties, carbon fiber adds structural integrity and visual interest. Its textured appearance creates a striking contrast to the matte titanium and gunmetal accents, highlighting the pen\u2019s modern sophistication.</p>\n<p>The titanium body is further complemented by gunmetal trim on the cap and other components, completing the sleek and cohesive design. This thoughtful combination of materials ensures strength, longevity, and a timeless aesthetic that seamlessly blends sophistication with innovation.</p>\n<p>Each pen is part of an individually numbered regular edition, with the unique serial number prominently displayed on the cap. This numbering emphasizes the pen\u2019s exclusivity and celebrates its collectible nature, making it a cherished item for writing enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike.</p>\n<p>The pen features a premium titanium grade 9 nib, engraved with the Monteverde USA logo, delivering smooth and consistent ink flow for a flawless writing experience. Grade 9 titanium, celebrated for its excellent balance of strength and flexibility, ensures a nib that is durable and capable of adapting to the writer's pressure for a responsive and personalized experience.</p>\n<p>Enhancing the nib's performance is the advanced plasma-treated feeder system, designed to provide a consistent and efficient ink flow. This cutting-edge technology eliminates skipping and blotting while promoting even ink distribution, ensuring a seamless writing experience regardless of speed or style.</p>\n<p>Titanium\u2019s corrosion-resistant and hypoallergenic properties add to the nib\u2019s longevity and comfort, making it suitable for users with sensitivities. Available in Fine and Medium nib sizes, the pen caters to a range of writing preferences. It fills via standard international ink cartridges or a converter (included), providing versatility and convenience for those who enjoy the tactile pleasure of fountain pen writing.</p>\n<p>Each Monteverde Innova Titanium pen is elegantly presented in a luxurious gift box with a custom-designed sleeve. Crafted from premium vegan leather, the box is both sophisticated and protective, ensuring an exceptional unboxing experience. Perfect for gifting, the packaging highlights the pen\u2019s elegance and exclusivity, making it a memorable choice for any occasion.<br><br>1999 Monteverde USA\u00ae was founded in Canoga Park, California USA with the intention to create writing instruments that feature unparalleled quality, function, and affordable luxury.</p>",

The three layers of durable black lacquer on this Monteverde Invincia Color Fusion pen create depth and brilliance with the barrel, clip and trim all in stealthed-out black. It fills via standard international ink cartridges or converter (included).</p>\n<p>This fountain pen is offered with your choice of a reliable, smooth-writing German made JoWo #6 black steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub or the new JoWo Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width. With six nib options, you are sure to find a selection to fit your handwriting style.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible short standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

Released as part of Monteverde's 25th-anniversary celebration, the MP1 Collectible represents a significant leap forward in the piston-fill fountain pen category, combining luxury with satisfying performance.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is its grip section and the radiant, crystal-clear barrel, which are crafted as a single transparent piece. This one-piece construction not only enhances the pen's durability and sleek aesthetic but also provides a smooth, uninterrupted surface that feels natural and comfortable in the hand. The continuous design ensures a perfect balance and a secure grip, making the pen exceptionally comfortable during extended writing sessions.</p>\n<p>The pen's design is further distinguished by its durable anodized aluminum cap in black, adorned with finely etched lines that add visual appeal.

The large 2ml ink reservoir, made of polycarbonate resin, ensures ample ink capacity, reducing the need for frequent refilling and maing it perfect for extensive writing sessions.</p>\n<p>Dark and sophisticated, the Black Noir MP1 Collectible offers a deep, rich black that conveys timeless elegance. The matte finish softens the black, giving it a smooth and subtle texture, while the gunmetal trim enhances the pen's modern and luxurious aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The Monteverde MP1 Collectible pen is beautifully packaged within a sleek, minimalist gift box, perfect for the discerning individual who appreciates both elegance and functionality. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Assembled at the Monteverde headquarters in California, the MP1 Collectible adheres to the highest standards of production and quality control, a testament to the brand's 25-year legacy of precise craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>With its lightweight yet durable construction, consistent ink flow, and elegant design, the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is a must-have for writing enthusiasts and pen collectors alike, offering a significant edge in features and value compared to its competitors.

    "description": "<p>Introducing the new Monteverde MP1 Collectible, the first piston fountain pen in the Monteverde collection, where innovation, elegance, and advanced technology converge in a meticulously crafted design. Released as part of Monteverde's 25th-anniversary celebration, the MP1 represents a significant leap forward in the piston-fill fountain pen category, combining luxury with satisfying performance.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is its grip section and the radiant, crystal-clear barrel, which are crafted as a single transparent piece. This one-piece construction not only enhances the pen's durability and sleek aesthetic but also provides a smooth, uninterrupted surface that feels natural and comfortable in the hand. The continuous design ensures a perf<img><img><img><img><img>ect balance and a secure grip, making the pen exceptionally comfortable during extended writing sessions.</p>\n<p>The pen's design is further distinguished by its durable anodized aluminum cap in grey, adorned with finely etched lines that add visual appeal. The anodized blind cap, equipped with a lock-in piston mechanism, ensures that the piston remains in place, preventing accidental twisting or ink spills, adding to the pen's overall reliability and functionality.</p>\n<p>At the core of the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is a finely crafted #6 premium German-made JoWo nib, renowned for its precision and silky smooth writing experience. The black steel nibs are offered in six distinctive point sizes: extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub, and finally the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.</p>\n<p>Paired with an expertly designed plasma-treated feed system, the pen delivers consistent, reliable ink flow, ensuring rich and even lines without skipping or blotting, regardless of your writing speed or style.</p>\n<p>The pen features an integrated piston-filling mechanism that allows for effortless ink refilling directly from an ink bottle, eliminating the need for cartridges and making the pen eco-friendly. The large 2ml ink reservoir, made of polycarbonate resin, ensures ample ink capacity, reducing the need for frequent refilling and maing it perfect for extensive writing sessions.</p>\n<p>The Coal Grey shade exudes understated elegance, blending cool, industrial tones with a sleek matte finish. The grey evokes a sense of modern sophisticiation, perfectly complemented by the gunmetal accents that add depth and subtle luxury to the overall design.</p>\n<p>The Monteverde MP1 Collectible pen is beautifully packaged within a sleek, minimalist gift box, perfect for the discerning individual who appreciates both elegance and functionality. Assembled at the Monteverde headquarters in California, the MP1 Collectible adheres to the highest standards of production and quality control, a testament to the brand's 25-year legacy of precise craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>With its lightweight yet durable construction, consistent ink flow, and elegant design, the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is a must-have for writing enthusiasts and pen collectors alike, offering a significant edge in features and value compared to its competitors. The Monteverde MP1 Collectible is an excellent choice for those seeking a professionally advanced piston-fill fountain pen that embodies reliability, durability, and user-friendly design.<br><br><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>",

    "description": "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">The 2025 Special Edition MP1 Collectible color is Mocha Mousse! This color matches the 2025 Pantone color of the year, and it comes with gunmetal trim that enhances the pen's modern and luxurious aesthetic. The color is <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>a warm, earthy taupe symbolizing balance, comfort, and modern elegance. </span>This gift set comes with a matching cylindrical pen holder made of aluminum along with a mocha mousse recipe, sticker, story card, and instructions.</p>\n<p>The Monteverde MP1 Collectible is the first piston fountain pen in the Monteverde collection, where innovation, elegance, and advanced technology converge in a meticulously crafted design. Released as part of Monteverde's 25th-anniversary celebration, the MP1 Collectible represents a significant leap forward in the piston-fill fountain pen category, combining luxury with satisfying performance.</p>\n<p>One of the standout features of the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is its grip section and the radiant, crystal-clear barrel, which are crafted as a single transparent piece. This one-piece construction not only enhances the pen's durability and sleek aesthetic but also provides a smooth, uninterrupted surface that feels natural and comfortable in the hand. The continuous design ensures a perfect balance and a secure grip, making the pen exceptionally comfortable during extended writing sessions.</p>\n<p>The pen's design is further distinguished by its durable anodized aluminum cap in brown, adorned with finely etched lines that add visual appeal. The anodized blind cap, equipped with a lock-in piston mechanism, ensures that the piston remains in place, preventing accidental twisting or ink spills, adding to the pen's overall reliability and functionality.</p>\n<p>At the core of the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is a finely crafted #6 premium German-made JoWo nib, renowned for its precision and silky smooth writing experience. The black steel nibs are offered in six distinctive point sizes: extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub, and finally the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.</p>\n<p>Paired with an expertly designed plasma-treated feed system, the pen delivers consistent, reliable ink flow, ensuring rich and even lines without skipping or blotting, regardless of your writing speed or style.</p>\n<p>The pen features an integrated piston-filling mechanism that allows for effortless ink refilling directly from an ink bottle, eliminating the need for cartridges and making the pen eco-friendly. The large 2ml ink reservoir, made of polycarbonate resin, ensures ample ink capacity, reducing the need for frequent refilling and making it perfect for extensive writing sessions.</p>\n<p>The Monteverde MP1 Collectible pen is beautifully packaged within a sleek, minimalist gift box, perfect for the discerning individual who appreciates both elegance and functionality.\u00a0<meta charset=\"utf-8\">Assembled at the Monteverde headquarters in California, the MP1 Collectible adheres to the highest standards of production and quality control, a testament to the brand's 25-year legacy of precise craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>With its lightweight yet durable construction, consistent ink flow, and elegant design, the Monteverde MP1 Collectible is a must-have for writing enthusiasts and pen collectors alike, offering a significant edge in features and value compared to its competitors. The Monteverde MP1 Collectible is an excellent choice for those seeking a professionally advanced piston-fill fountain pen that embodies reliability, durability, and user-friendly design.<br><br><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Introducing a new Goulet-exclusive, special edition fountain pen collection! The Monteverde Prima is back but this time with a new twist: a built-in piston mechanism.</p>\n<p>This Prima Piston fountain pen features a clear ink barrel so you can see your ink and the piston mechanism at work, complemented by a semi-translucent purple marbled resin cap. It is completed with rose-gold plated trim and a matching nib.</p>\n<p>Paired with an expertly designed plasma-treated feed system, the pen delivers consistent, reliable ink flow, ensuring rich and even lines without skipping or blotting, regardless of your writing speed or style.</p>\n<p>The pen features an integrated piston-filling mechanism that allows for effortless ink refilling directly from an ink bottle, eliminating the need for cartridges and making the pen eco-friendly. The large ink reservoir, made of polycarbonate resin, ensures ample ink capacity, reducing the need for frequent refilling and making it perfect for extensive writing sessions.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">The Prima is fitted with a finely crafted #6 premium German-made JoWo nib, renowned for its precision and silky smooth writing experience. The rose gold-plated steel nibs are offered in six distinctive point sizes: extra-fine, fine, medium, broad, 1.1mm stub, and finally the Omniflex flexible steel nib for variation in line width.</p>\n<p><em>Our note about the JoWo Omniflex nib:</em> This flex nib will allow you to experience more bounce and softness than writing with conventional nibs. You can achieve some line variation with a little additional downward pressure, to a point. We recommend flexing the nib to about twice the line width that you would see without using any pressure. Please take care to avoid pressing too hard on the nib, as over-flexing could prevent the tines from returning fully to their original position and decrease or stop your ink flow.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Namiki Aya fountain pen collection is the newest maki-e model from Namiki, with designs lacquered by the highly revered\u00a0<meta charset=\"utf-8\">Kokkokai group. The barrel artwork was designed using traditional maki-e urushi lacquer work and finished with a sprinkling of gold and silver dust using the togidashi polishing technique. Each pen features different colored urushi lacquer to create the rich hues of nature.</p>\n<p>Tokiwa (Evergreen): a Japanese word for 'something that will never change.' This design expresses the evergreen trees on a mountain that flourish without their leaves losing color, even in winter. Dried green lacquer powders are applied with varying intensities to symbolize the landscapes of mountains using gradient coloring. Crushed abalone shells and gold-flat-powders are used in the background to evoke a starry night.</p>\n<p>The Namiki Aya Collection has a classical vest-type body style and is enhanced with an oversized No. 30 two-tone 18k gold nib featuring the iconic silhouette of Mount Fuji, available in Fine Medium, Medium, or Broad nib sizes. The Aya fountain pen collection offers effortless, smooth writing and is designed to delight the fountain pen collector.</p>\n<p>This classical fountain pen is refillable for continued use with a Pilot ink cartridge or Pilot\u2019s CON-70 converter, both of which are included, and arrives packaged in a beautiful Namiki wooden giftbox.<br><br><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>\u00a0to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>Pilot is excited to announce the launch of the newest addition to the Chinkin collection, \u201cBamboo and Sparrow,\u201d Yukari maki-e fountain pen. This incredible fountain pen features a stunning sparrow motif surrounded by elegant bamboo, painstakingly etched and filled in with gold powder. The symbolism of bamboo is strong and positive, hence the Japanese proverb \"The bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists\". Represented in pairs, it doubles the luck factor. The sparrow, considered a songbird, brings good times with family or friends. A sparrow also is used in Japanese folklore and artwork to denote a gentle natured, intellectual person.</p>\n<p>The renowned artisan, Yasuji Sumi, used the unique Chinkin technique to create this design. Each pen is truly a masterpiece. Remarkable skill and impeccable craftsmanship bring the sparrow and bamboo to life through the complex patterns of carved dots and lines that are illuminated with gold powder. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word. The result is breathtaking.</p>\n<p>The Yukari Chinkin Bamboo and Sparrow is available with a #10 18 karat gold nib in Fine, Medium, or Broad.It\u00a0fills via Pilot/Namiki cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged with a bottle of Namiki Blue ink in a velvet-lined wooden box.<br><br> The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use \"Chinkin (Gold Inlay)\", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>Pilot is excited to announce the launch of the newest addition to the Chinkin collection, the Chinkin Dragon maki-e fountain pen. This incredible fountain pen features a stunning dragon motif, painstakingly etched and filled in with gold powder. The Dragon is a traditional mythical creature that is both fierce and powerful, and dragon imagery is prevalent across cultures around the globe. In Japanese mythology the Dragon is depicted a noble water-based creature, who protects those around them. In this maki-e Chinkin design, the dragon is depicted exactly how the Japanese folklore describes them with a refined serpentine body, three visible claws and a ferocious face. The dragon is seen holding a round, circular jewel which is said to bring good fortune. This jewel is featured on the pen barrel under the ball of the elegant gold clip.<br><br>The unique Chinkin technique used to craft this pen makes each one a masterpiece. Remarkable skill and impeccable craftsmanship bring the Dragon to life through the complex patterns of carved dots and lines that are illuminated with gold powder. The artist, Yasuji Sumi, has enhanced the dragon\u2019s body and face with multiple Chinkin layers, creating an intricate design that is not typically utilized on other Chinkin pens. The result is breathtaking.</p>\n<p>The Chinkin Emperor Dragon is available with a #50 18k gold nib in Fine-Medium, Medium, or Broad. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in an elegant presentation box with a bottle of blue ink and signature card. Each pen takes months to create. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br><i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>Namiki is proud to announce the 2025 Limited Edition Emperor fountain pen, Blooming Flowers in\u00a0Profusion. After much anticipation, this year\u2019s release debuts as the most ambitious and valuable limited\u00a0edition Emperor ever created under the Namiki name.<br></p>\n<p>Inspired by the classical Japanese idiom \u201c\u767e\u82b1\u7e5a\u4e71\u201d (Hyakka Ry\u014dran), which means \u201ca profusion of flowers\u00a0in bloom,\u201d the design symbolizes a flourishing of culture, artistry, and individuality. Eleven varieties of\u00a0flowers from the four seasons of Japan are exquisitely arranged across the Emperor vest-type body, each\u00a0realized with different maki-e techniques to highlight its unique beauty. Together, these blossoms express not only the richness of nature but also the beauty of a society that celebrates individuality while honoring harmony and mutual respect.</p>\n<p>Maki-e, the centuries-old Japanese art of painting with lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder, is at the heart of this pen. Each flower is rendered with a different technique: Hira Maki-e, where designs are painted flat and polished to a smooth finish; Taka Maki-e, which builds raised relief for dimensional detail; Raden, which inlays shimmering fragments of mother-of-pearl; Rankaku, which incorporates the delicate<br>texture of quail eggshell; and Togidashi Maki-e, where layers of lacquer and sprinkled powders are polished back to reveal a luminous, unified surface. Together, these methods create depth, brilliance, and harmony across the full composition.</p>\n<p>Spring is represented by Cherry Blossom, Violet, and Wisteria, all delicately rendered in Hira Maki-e (Flat Maki-e). Summer blooms with Clematis and Sweet Lily in Hira Maki-e, while Hydrangea shimmers with a combination of Hira Maki-e and Raden (mother-of-pearl). Autumn brings Dianthus in bold Hira Maki-e, Bellflower enhanced with Raden, and the noble Chrysanthemum, painstakingly depicted in Taka Maki-e (Raised Maki-e). Winter is marked by Plum Blossom, finely detailed in Rankaku (eggshell), and the Winter Peony, given dramatic depth through Taka Maki-e.<br></p>\n<p>To unify the composition, the life-giving forces of Earth and Water are expressed with gold, silver, and\u00a0raden powders in Togidashi Maki-e, creating a luminous background that elevates the vibrancy of the\u00a0flowers. This layered artistry reflects the philosophy of Hyakka Ry\u014dran: the flourishing of individuality,\u00a0diversity, and the beauty of coexistence.<br>Crafted by KOKKOKAI artisan Yutaka Sato, each pen is a masterpiece of Japanese lacquer art. Each pen\u00a0requires an extraordinary amount of time, with every flower applied in layers of lacquer, gold, raden, and\u00a0eggshell, painstakingly polished between applications. The Emperor body is fitted with Namiki\u2019s signature\u00a0#50 size 18-karat gold nib, accented with rhodium plating with the iconic image of Mount Fuji. Only 99\u00a0pieces will be produced worldwide.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><br><i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "This Namiki Emperor fountain pen was just released in late 2016 and has been decorated with maki-e by the skilled artisan Mamoru in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), and depicts two dragons, one on the cap and one on the barrel. Raden abalone shells accent the background. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.<br><br> Enthralled by the intriguing beauty of the mythical creatures, Namiki beautifully captures the magnificence and quintessence of the Dragon. Fearsome and powerful, dragons are also considered benevolent and the bringers of wealth and good fortune. In Japanese mythology, the dragon is highly-regarded as the Guardian of the East and symbolizes strength, power and protection. It is also known a symbol of fertility, wealth and success.<br><br> There are two types of Japanese dragons; one belonging to the sky while the other is found in bodies of water, and as such is reflected in the cap and body of this pen. The sky dragon depicted on the cap of the fountain pen is seen fiercely guarding the pearl within its three-clawed grasp, believed to be the wish-fulfilling pearl jewel. The magic ball is also known as Cintamani, a sacred stone that gives power and makes its possessor's wishes come true. As the dragon is endowed with supernatural powders, it is also usually linked to water. Thus the dragon in the air uses the Cintamani power to attract rain in the spring and avoid floods in the fall.<br><br> The Taka Maki-e technique helps to accentuate the awesome presence of the two auspicious dragons. Waves and clouds are treated with silver Taka Maki-e creating the perfect contrast with these golden dragons. In the background, the Togidashi and Raden Maki-e techniques are on display, with a black lacquer studded with multicolored glittering abalone shell particles.<br><br> As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.</i>",

The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.</p>\n<p>The Kylin is thought to have a compound appearance with a dragon\u2019s head, antlers, horse hoofs, an oxtail, wolf\u2019s forehead and a colorful chest. It is lively, intelligent and most of all gentle but valorous to ward off devils. To see a Kylin is a good omen that brings rui, roughly translated as \"serenity\" or \"prosperity\" and it is the custom in some regions, to believe that the Kylin will give them a son.</p>\n<p>Although it looks fearsome, the Kylin only punishes the wicked. It can walk on grass yet not trample the blades, and it can also walk on water. As it is a peaceful creature, its diet does not include flesh. It takes great care when it walks never to harm or tread on any living thing, and it is said to appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader (some say even if this area is only a house). It is normally gentle but can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a sinner, spouting flames from its mouth and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story.</p>\n<p>Legends tell that the Kylin has appeared in the garden of the legendary Huangdi and in the capital of Emperor Yao. Both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It's been told in legends that the birth of the great sage Confucius was foretold by the arrival of a Kylin.</p>\n<p>As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.</p>\n<p><i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>Pilot is delighted to share the latest edition to the Emperor Collection: The Rakucho Birds and Weeping Cherry Blossom! The Rakucho is a mythical bird that is said to fly around a heavenly paradise and symbolizes an ambient, peaceful environment. This unique pen design features two Rakucho birds which represent eternal love and happy marriage. The birds were created by using the traditional Togidashi Taka Maki-e technique which adds both a distinctive texture and vibrant color. The Rakuchos are seen flying around beautiful weeping cherry blossom branches. The background of the pen body was crafted to look like the distinctive, charcoal hue and texture of cherry blossom bark. The bark and branches were designed using the complex Oh-hi-nuri, a type of Kawari-nuri technique which has never been featured before on Pilot\u2019s Namiki maki-e pens. The cherry blossom petals are inlaid with mother of pearl and polished for a lustrous finish.<br><br> This stunning emperor body fountain pen symbolizes love, serenity and tradition and is truly a work of art. Designed by the renowned artisan Mashiro Yamada, it has a massive #50 18k gold nib that features the customary Mount Fuji illustration. Nib sizes are available in Fine-Medium, Medium, or Broad.</p>\n<p>The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in an elegant presentation box with a bottle of blue ink and signature card. Each pen takes months to create. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "This Namiki Emperor maki-e fountain pen was created by maki-e artisan Yutaka in Japan in early 2015. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), as well as Rankaku (quail shells). This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.<br><br> In the Japanese culture, the owl, or \"Fukuro\", means luck and protection from hardship or suffering. Using ebonite as its base, the Rankaku Maki-e is used to design both the owls on the pen, and the Raden technique is used to embed the eyes of the owls making them sparkle. A layer of clear urushi lacquer is then used to protect the surface of the pen giving it a glossy polish. The Rankaku artwork is simply outstanding with the incredible attention to detail.<br><br> Two owls can be seen on the pen. The owl on the cap is perched on a Quercusserate tree, showcasing the nocturnal bird\u2019s exceptional ability in seeking out its prey in the still of the night. The owl in the barrel is depicted silently flapping its wings and swooping in for the kill.<br><br> The Rankaku technique is a unique method whereby the motifs are designed using the powder or small pieces of quail shells. They are fixed into the lacquer and later coated with another layer of lacquer. The layer of lacquer is then burnished to reveal the design of the pen. The Raden technique, on the other hand, is a technique whereby the stratum of various abalone shells are peeled into thin layers. Then they are cut into small pieces before being coated with urushi lacquer to hold them in place. The urushi is then burnished to create a finish.<br><br> As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique, as well as inlaid gold dust. It comes individually packaged in a wooden box with a 50ml bottle of matching limited edition green-black Iroshizuku ink and a leather pen wrap. This exquisitely lacquered brass fountain pen has a medium 18k gold nib in size #10, is complemented by gold trim, and fills via cartridge/converter (a Con-70 is included). Only 150 limited pens have been produced of each design worldwide.</p>\n<p>Said to be the incarnation of the Buddhist deity <em>Maitreya</em> Bodhisattva, Hotei-son, who dates back to the Chinese <em>Tang</em> Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) is unique among the Seven Gods of Good Fortune for being the only monk. Hotei-son is widely regarded as a god of good fortune and matrimonial happiness, believed to impart riches, status and prosperity.</p>\n<p>On the fountain pen, he is depicted among the Chinese mountains, and boasts a happy smile, as well as a plump face and potbelly. On his shoulder, he carries a large <em>\ufeffKannin-bukuro</em>\ufeff, or patience bag, said to contain the many treasures and blessings he bestows on others.</p>\n<p>The black-green ink echoes the color of Hotei-son\u2019s necklace, depicted on the fountain pen.</p>\n\n<p>As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br><i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>The motif of this pen features an assortment of beautiful cherry blossoms, one of the most familiar flowers in Japan.<br></p>\n<p>The cherry blossoms in full bloom herald the arrival of spring and attract people from all over the world. The beauty of\u00a0cherry blossoms at night, known as \"yozakura,\" is expressed in this design using the Flat Maki-e and Raden\u00a0techniques. These techniques capture the enchanting spectacle of cherry blossoms illuminating the night, a phenomenon called \"hana akari,\" which provides a serene and peaceful glow even in darkness.<br></p>\n<p>The cherry blossoms are painted and then applied with rounded gold powders, followed by a coating of pink urushi lacquer. Cherry blossom petals and the background are created with Burnished Maki-e. This involves applying small pieces of Raden (mother-of-pearl) and black lacquer, which are then polished to reveal the intricate design. The finials also utilize the Burnished Maki-e technique, with flattened silver powders and black lacquer to achieve a stunning finish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This exquisite piece is crafted by the renowned Kokkokai artisan, Yumi Hayashi, whose signature appears on each pen as a mark of its exceptional craftsmanship. The pen has an 18k gold nib (#10), fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink.\u00a0As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.</p>\n<p><em>Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

    "description": "This Namiki Yukari Royale Frog maki-e fountain pen was created in 2017 in Japan by maki-e artisan Yumi Hayashi, who also has the distinction of being the first woman hired as a Maki-e artist by Namiki. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting frogs, leaves, and water designs. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #20, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink.<br><br>Extraordinary artistry and craftsmanship, along with superior attention to detail, embody the essence of the Japanese Maki-e art form. The exquisite hyper-realistic, animal inspired design of the Yukari Royale Frog is brought to life through the thousands of skillful touches of the master artisan. The artisan started with drawing the intricate lines of the frogs, leaves and water designs on the lustrous black Urushi lacquer surface, and then skillfully sprinkled 18-karat gold foil and powder in a continuous manner creating a dimensional, powerful and expressive masterpiece.<br><br>Captured stunningly on the body of the fountain pen, the artisan has expressed the passage of time by portraying a variety of flowers that come into bloom at different times throughout the year. The tranquil flow of water is expressed with luminous Raden (Mother-of-pearl) and Kawari-nuri. Also among the carefully curated scene are three golden frogs dynamically depicted moving around in a lively manner. Frogs in Japanese, also referred to as \u201ckaeru,\u201d are known to be a popular motif as a lucky charm that will bring health, longevity, protection and wealth. <br><br>Each year, after hibernating, the frog has the peculiarity to go back to the pond of its birth, whatever the distance, for reproduction. Its name in Japanese (kaeru) is pronounced the same way as the word, which means return. This characteristic has made it a protective animal for travelers (often as protective amulets) and the symbol of hospitality. Symbol of fertility, because it lays numerous eggs in one go, the frog is also the one of happy returns of any kind, chance, age, happiness, money, etc. It is also thought to give the power of attracting wealth (it was the emblem of the tax collectors in feudal times). At last, it represents resurrection and metamorphosis, the perpetual transformation of man.<br><br><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

    "description": "<p>The new addition to Namiki\u2019s Yukari Royale collection is the \u201cLioness and Cubs\u201d Maki-e fountain pen. Extraordinary artistry and craftsmanship, along with superior attention to detail, embody the essence of the Japanese Maki-e art form.<br><br>This exquisite, hyper-realistic design of the Yukari Royale Lioness and Cubs brings to life the phrase \u201cSpare the rod and spoil the child.\u201d This longstanding story also mirrors the parenting technique said to be used by lions. The lioness will leave her offspring at the bottom of a ravine to encourage her cubs to rally their strength to get out of the depths of the canyon. Only the strong cubs will persevere. This scene is a parable that only parents with deep wisdom, discipline and strong principles are capable of following in the lioness\u2019 parenting footsteps.<br><br>The Namiki Yukari Royale was created using a burnished-raised Maki-e style called Togidashi-taka Maki-e. The artisans painted the pen with a lacquer and used gold and silver powder to sprinkle over the exquisite design. Then, the artisans use charcoal to delicately scrape the surface until their intricate design is revealed.<br><br>This stunning fountain pen is complemented with a choice of fine, medium or broad 18kt, rhodium adorned #20 gold nib which bears the Namiki logo as well as an engraving of the highest, most majestic mountain in Japan, Mount Fuji.

It features the togidashi-taka maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting beautiful peony flowers and blue butterflies with raden inlaid into the wings. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #20, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink.<br><br>A peony plant produces glorious, stunning, large bloomed flowers and the bark of the plant was first harvested for medicinal use in Japan sometime during 500 BC by Buddhist monks. The magnificent beauty of the flower, however, attracted more attention than the medicinal value. Peonies in full bloom have been depicted around the world in elegant artwork and literature since ancient times. Specifically, in Japan there is a traditional discipline for flowers called Hanakotoba, which is translated to mean the \u201clanguage using flowers.\u201d Hanakotoba is an unspoken form of communication that uses florals for specific expressions of feelings. Peonies denote bravery, regality, and a distinguished presence. <br><br>This Yukari Royale fountain pen features the taka maki-e technique for both peonies\u2019 blooms and leaves. Dancing around the peonies are beautiful, royal blue butterflies with raden (iridescent, multifaceted Mother-of- Pearl, which makes each pen unique) specially inlaid in the wings. Butterflies are naturally drawn to these flowers. Both the flowers and the butterflies showcased are expressed through togidashi-taka maki-e techniques (burnished-raised design applying a layer of lacquer, sprinkling gold or silver powder and drying with an additional lacquer layer to fix the powder). The background is the traditional black lacquer accentuated with gold powder.<br><br>The Yukari Royale Peony will be a regularly featured item in the Namiki line. Each pen is carefully crafted and painted with the artisan\u2019s signature.

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity.

The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water.

    "description": "<p>Introducing the newest flex pen from Noodler's! The Triple Tail features a new body resin which is a cotton butyrate mix. It has a more clear body than other clear Noodler's models. The Triple Tail also features a new three-tined #6 flex steel nib which is smooth as butter and lays down a generous amount of ink with nice line variation. The nib and feed feature a threaded housing.<br><br>To fill the pen, submerge the nib and feed into your ink bottle, then move the filler rod two full strokes. Wipe excess ink off, and you're good to write! <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6.84ml ink capacity! </span>The entire pen can be disassembled and reassembled by hand.</p>\n<p>It also accepts the Noodler's 308 refillable cartridges.<br><br>The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed twist right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://noodlersink.com/wp-content/uploads/triple-tail-instructions.pdf\" title=\"Noodlers Triple Tail Flex Pen Instruction Sheet\">Click here</a> to download the printable PDF instruction sheet for the Noodler's Triple Tail Flex Pen.</p>",

The Harmony is an eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve.\u00a0 It has a rose gold-plated clip and a rose gold-plated stainless steel #6 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Complemented with an ivory colored finial and end cap, and a translucent light pink/purple cap and barrel, Mocha Mousse is a limited edition design for 2025.</p>\n<p>An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity. Having a transparent pen barrel allows you to see your current ink level.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Souver\u00e4n - A world-famous classic. Even today, this classic with a black-and-green pinstripe sleeve is still considered a symbol of the Pelikan brand worldwide. The production of the Souver\u00e4n sleeve is subject to an elaborate process. The classic\u00a0striped material is made out of cotton based on a formula developed\u00a0specifically for Pelikan. It takes months until the block providing the stripes is finished, whereupon the tailor-made plating is curved and cut into a contour using a natural diamond. The characteristic double rings are then integrated into the cap and barrel with the utmost precision. The writing instrument is then polished until it reaches a brilliant luster. <br><br>The Pelikan Souver\u00e4n M1000 is Pelikan's flagship fountain pen. The elaborately striped green body is made of celluloid acetate, with a black cap and 24k gold plated accents. The large nib is made of 18k gold, refined with a rhodium decor, and writing quality tested by hand.<br><br>The fountain pen\u00a0is equipped with a differential piston-filling mechanism with high-value brass components. The smooth operating piston mechanism allows you to fill this pen with bottled ink, and an ink window allows you to see your ink level.</p>",

His humorous pen-and-ink illustrations garnered respect particularly in the world of advertising having a decisive influence on commercial art. His work was characterized by flowing lines, ornamental designs, and stylized figures.\u00a0 The pen based off of his design, features an interesting shade of green resin for the section, piston knob, and cap.

    "description": "<p>The art of damascening is handcrafted at the highest level and is thousands of years old. With the \u201cToledo\u201d fountain pen, Pelikan pays tribute to this technique with a love of detail.\u00a0The new Special Edition Toledo M910 White celebrates this special craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>The biggest highlight of this edition is the decorative sleeve. Several elaborate steps are necessary to refine the detailed pelican motif on the barrel. The special pelican motif is refined by hand by a goldsmith with many expressive details, so that the very individual expression gives the writing instrument its vibrancy. Two pelican motifs can be seen on the surrounding 925 sterling silver sleeve: a small pelican stands together in front of a pelican with widened wings and the second motif shows a pelican with an open beak. Both motifs are framed by ornaments.</p>\n<p>During the manufacturing process, the design is etched onto the sleeve and then the filigree details are stitched by hand. Finally, the surface of the barrel is coated with palladium.</p>\n<p>The fountain pen is fitted with a 18k gold nib. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">The smooth operating piston mechanism allows you to fill this pen with bottled ink.</p>\n<p>Each Toledo writing instrument is unique and handmade in Germany. Each for itself is a great masterpiece - and a little piece of history. The Toledo M910 White is available only for a limited time and comes in a high-quality, white piano lacquered Toledo gift box.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Pilot Custom 74 is a simple yet sophisticated fountain pen. Pilot is pleased to announce the launch of their newest US Exclusive: Lavender Fog. This serene, opaque lavender barrel with silver trim evokes a quiet stillness\u2014like morning mist clinging to a hillside just before the world wakes up. Elegant and contemplative, Lavender Fog captures a subtle emotional palette: softness, clarity, and calm intention.<br></p>\n<p>The Custom 74 is a beloved model in Pilot\u2019s Fine Writing lineup, known for its transparent body and smooth #5\u00a0size 14-karat gold nib. This exclusive edition departs from the norm with a unique opaque finish and rhodium-\u00a0plated nib, available only in four rare nib sizes: Soft Fine, Soft Fine Medium, Soft Medium, and Double Broad.</p>\n<p>These expressive nibs offer enhanced line variation and a graceful, cushioned feel across the page. A special mechanism in the converter ensures a fluid and continuous flow of ink with no skipping for a premium, expressive writing experience. The #5 nib is finely crafted from 14-karat gold.</p>\n<p>This pen is refillable for continued use with a proprietary Pilot ink cartridge or Pilot\u2019s CON-70 converter (both are included) and arrives packaged in a striking presentation box. The Pilot CON-70 converter holds an ample ink supply while uniquely combining the characteristics of a vacuum-filling and push-button converter.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Pilot Custom Urushi lacquered ebonite fountain pen was created by maki-e artisans (kokkokai) in Japan. It features the Roiro Urushi technique in solid vermillion red. The pen has a two-tone 18k gold nib in the large #30 size. A Pilot Con-70 converter is included, but you can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges if you prefer. It comes packaged in a gift box. <br><br>Lacquering has been used in Japan for thousands of years. The Pilot Custom Urushi is crafted from Japanese ebonite and lacquered using only pure Urushi lacquer. Like their Namiki pens, Pilot uses a lacquering technique called Roiro, which requires substantial time and skill to create a uniform and mirror-like finish. Each Custom Urushi pen is lacquered, cured, and polished three times to create a beautiful quality result.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><em>Please note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

    "description": "<p>The Pilot Falcon (previously known as the Namiki Falcon) is an iconic pen in the fountain pen world. It is most famous for its 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid black fountain pen has gold trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box.<br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a \"flex\" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. <br><br> The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br>The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br><br> While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

It is most famous for its rhodium-plated 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid purple fountain pen has rhodium trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box. This color is a US exclusive!<br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a \"flex\" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. <br><br> The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br>The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br> While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Pilot Metal Falcon is a metal version of the very popular Falcon series. Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this pale blue fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter. <i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">There has been a slight change to the Con-70 converter design, so the one you receive may vary from what is pictured here.</i><br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents. <br><br> This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

The unique parallel plate structure achieves a more beautiful and sharper handwriting than existing calligraphy pens. This product comes with a Parallel pen with a huge 6.0mm stub italic nib, one black and one red ink cartridge, a converter to flush the pen, and a nib cleaner.<br><br>Using two Pilot Parallel Pens, each with different Pilot Parallel Mixable color cartridges, you produce beautifully gradated lettering by touching the nibs together before writing. To use with bottled fountain pen ink, the Pilot Con-40 converter works best (sold separately).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

The pen feels very well made, is ergonomically lightweight, and the steel nib is delightfully thin enough that you can use it for everyday writing. Each pen comes with a CON-40 converter and an ink cartridge to get you started writing right away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Pilot Sterling fountain pen is handcrafted from genuine sterling silver. Each pen is engraved with an exquisite detailed design, a symbol chosen by Pilot to reflect an important facet of Japanese culture. \"Koushi\" is  a design which depicts a grid-like pattern resembling a door on an old Japanese house.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fountain pen features a rhodium-plated 18k gold inlaid nib. A CON-40 converter is included with each pen, but they will also accept Pilot proprietary ink cartridges. </p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The snap cap secures the pen when not in use and although it\u2019s a bit heavy, it will post to make a nicely balanced pen when writing. The overall weight of a pen in the Sterling collection is around 34 grams, making it fairly comparable to the Pilot Metal Falcon. While tarnishing may be a concern given the material of the pen, the included polishing cloth will ensure easy, convenient cleaning of the pen body to keep away blemishes. The design on each pen will not hinder this cleaning either and allows for thorough, complete polishing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>2025 marks a momentous milestone in Pilot\u2019s Vanishing Point legacy: the 20th Anniversary of the Vanishing Point D\u00e9cimo. This is the very first worldwide limited-edition piece in the D\u00e9cimo line. The design pays tribute to Pilot's origin story: in 1925, founders Ryosuke Namiki and Masao Wada set sail from Yokohama, carrying Japanese-made gold-nib fountain pens to the world. Their pioneering voyage inspires this edition\u2019s theme: Voyage, Challenge, and Pioneering.</p>\n<p>The Vanishing Point Decimo brings a new level of contemporary artistry to the Vanishing Point family. Redesigned and refined with a slimmer and lighter weight barrel, this fountain pen features a blue to orange ombre lacquer finish with silver trim.</p>\n<p>This fountain pen comes with a retractable rhodium-plated 18k gold nib - just click to expose or retract the nib. A hidden trap door helps keep the nib from drying out when not in use.</p>\n<p>A Pilot CON-40 converter is included with this pen, as well as a Pilot ink cartridge. A metal cartridge cap is also included for use with the ink cartridge.</p>\n<p>Each Vanishing Point fountain pen is beautifully merchandised in a black gift box. Immerse yourself in a svelte and luxurious writing experience!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>\u00a0to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen has a black barrel made of birchwood with rhodium accents. This fountain pen comes with a retractable rhodium plated 18k gold nib - just click to expose or retract the nib. A hidden trap door helps keep the nib from drying out when not in use. A Pilot CON-40 converter is included with this pen, as well as a Pilot ink cartridge. A metal cartridge cap is also included for use with the ink cartridge. Each Vanishing Point fountain pen is beautifully merchandised in a black gift box.<br><br>Birchwood was carefully selected for its elegant grain patterns, smooth texture, and comfortable grip. This premium material enhances the writing experience with its natural warmth while offering a distinctive aesthetic that sets it apart from traditional metal or resin finishes.</p>\n<p>While wood is naturally prone to absorbing moisture, dimensional changes, and machining challenges, Pilot has overcome these limitations through an advanced resin-infusion process. This enhances the wood\u2019s durability and stability, allowing for precise craftsmanship while preserving the organic beauty of the grain.</p>\n<p>From a manufacturing perspective, birchwood offers a unique advantage \u2013 it can be made thinner than other woods while still retaining strength. This allows for the creation of delicate components, like finely cut screw threads, that would be difficult to achieve with other types of wood. Even so, working with resin-infusion birchwood remains more complex than machining traditional metals or plastics, making each Birchwood Vanishing Point a testament to Pilot\u2019s technical expertise and meticulous craftsmanship.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>\u00a0to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen has a red barrel made of birchwood with rhodium accents. This fountain pen comes with a retractable rhodium plated 18k gold nib - just click to expose or retract the nib. A hidden trap door helps keep the nib from drying out when not in use. A Pilot CON-40 converter is included with this pen, as well as a Pilot ink cartridge. A metal cartridge cap is also included for use with the ink cartridge. Each Vanishing Point fountain pen is beautifully merchandised in a black gift box.<br><br>Birchwood was carefully selected for its elegant grain patterns, smooth texture, and comfortable grip. This premium material enhances the writing experience with its natural warmth while offering a distinctive aesthetic that sets it apart from traditional metal or resin finishes.</p>\n<p>While wood is naturally prone to absorbing moisture, dimensional changes, and machining challenges, Pilot has overcome these limitations through an advanced resin-infusion process. This enhances the wood\u2019s durability and stability, allowing for precise craftsmanship while preserving the organic beauty of the grain.</p>\n<p>From a manufacturing perspective, birchwood offers a unique advantage \u2013 it can be made thinner than other woods while still retaining strength. This allows for the creation of delicate components, like finely cut screw threads, that would be difficult to achieve with other types of wood. Even so, working with resin-infusion birchwood remains more complex than machining traditional metals or plastics, making each Birchwood Vanishing Point a testament to Pilot\u2019s technical expertise and meticulous craftsmanship.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pilot Corporation of America proudly introduces the 2025 Limited Edition Vanishing Point, Link Midnight. The latest in the celebrated Link series, Link Midnight invites you into a world shaped by the quiet energy of the night\u2014refined, enigmatic, and deeply inspired.</p>\n<p>This edition features a barrel adorned with a deep blue textured pattern reminiscent of woven metalwork\u2014a nod to both engine-turned Guilloche designs and modern mesh textiles. The result is a complex surface that offers a striking visual shimmer and a uniquely tactile writing experience. Matte black accents complement the dark blue finish, while a smoky black ion-plated 18kt gold nib completes the pen\u2019s quietly bold aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Link Midnight captures the allure of exclusivity and understated elegance. Inspired by the mystery and stillness of nighttime hours, this pen was designed for those who appreciate writing instruments that are as expressive as they are technically impressive. It's a tool for storytelling, memory-making, and creative discovery.</p>\n<p>Each pen is fitted with a medium nib and presented in a specially designed gift box. Limited to 2,025 pieces worldwide, Link Midnight builds on the legacy of celebrated editions like the 2020 Link Black.</p>\n<p>Crafted in Japan and engineered with precision, the 2025 Limited Edition Vanishing Point Link Midnight is a true expression of Pilot\u2019s dedication to innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless design.</p>\n<p>This fountain pen comes with a retractable 18k gold nib - just click to expose or retract the nib. A hidden trap door helps keep the nib from drying out when not in use. A Pilot CON-40 converter is included with this pen, as well as a Pilot ink cartridge.</p>\n<p>A metal cartridge cap is also included for use with the ink cartridge. Each Vanishing Point fountain pen is beautifully merchandised in a special gift box, and is individually numbered out of 2024 along the pen's center band.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

The stunning and vibrant marble-colored black\u00a0resin\u00a0body extends sophistication to your writing style. Every single pen is one-of-a-kind because no two marbling patterns are the same. Designed to delight the fountain pen collector; the pen\u2019s exceptional body is enhanced with lustrous rhodium accents. <br><br> The Vanishing Point fountain pen by Pilot is the world\u2019s first and favorite retractable fountain pen. The Vanishing Point was revolutionary when it was engineered in 1963 and continues to be unmatched in both design and writing performance. The precision engineering of the fountain pen barrel and internal mechanisms allow the nib to retract completely when not in use. The Vanishing Point nib is expertly crafted in 18-karat gold for exquisite writing performance what conforms to your writing style. <br><br> Rhodium is considered the rarest most valuable precious metal in the world \u2013 even more so than gold or platinum. Rhodium is both beautiful and durable which ensures the nib and accents will never corrode and remain pristine.<br><br>Each Vanishing Point SE fountain pen is beautifully merchandised in an elegant gift box. A Pilot CON-40 converter is included with this pen for use with bottled ink, as well as a blue Pilot ink cartridge. A metal cartridge cap is also included for use with the ink cartridge. The Vanishing Point SE uses the same replacement nib unit as the other Vanishing Point models.<br></p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same. We cannot honor special requests.</i></p>\n<p><a title=\"Pilot Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Pilot ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Pineider Avatar UR fountain pen collection was designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar UR marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special magnetic twist cap lock design that provides extra protection.</p>\n<p>This matte black fountain pen features a black #6 steel nib engraved with the Pineider logo, and is complemented by black trim. This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.</p>\n<p>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</p>\n<p>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.</p>\n<p>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.</p>\n<p>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</p>\n<p>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider\u2019s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm\u2019s illustrious name.</p>\n<p>Click to shop all compatible <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">short</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/long-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Long Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">long</a> standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

It comes with a smooth writing gold-plated steel nib and a Platinum ink cartridge (converter sold separately). <meta charset=\"utf-8\">We noticed when writing with it that this nib has more drag than most other nibs, so it will not glide as smoothly. It's not scratchy, it is just ground to a rougher finish. It works great for writers who really want to feel the paper under their nib. If you prefer smoother nibs, you should probably sit this one out.\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/platinum-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Platinum Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a>\u00a0to shop all compatible Platinum ink cartridges.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The stunning craftsmanship and irresistible glitter effect on the Platinum Raden Izumo Galaxy fountain pen beautifully captures the stars in the night sky. The delightful two-tone 18k gold nib is a perfect combination of technical genius and vintage design.<br><br>The Raden Izumo fountain pen is set in a wooden gift box with a 30ml glass bottle of Platinum Blue-Black ink, a Platinum Blue-Black ink cartridge, a Platinum converter with gold trim, and a silver gray pen pouch.<br><br><i>Izumo Raden</i> \"Galaxy\" <br><br>The <i>\"Izumo\"</i> brand of Platinum Pen is one of the ultimate version of traditional Japanese techniques. The fountain pen \"Galaxy\" is the voluminous <i>\"Izumo\"</i> body which is generously sprinkled with <i>Raden</i> (mother-of-pearl). <br><br>The universe in your hand. First the ebony body is shaped and carved. <i>Urushi nuri</i> (Japanese lacquer) is applied, and finely crushed mother-of-pearl is placed for the reflection of light. After about 6 months of lacquering, drying, and polishing, the \"Galaxy\" where countless stars emerge from jet black is born. <br><br>What is <i>Raden</i><br><br>A decorative technique commonly used for the traditional crafts such as lacquerware. The inside of the shell, the part of the nacre with iridescent luster, is cut out in a plate shape. The technique of pasting on <i>Urushi</i> lacquer or wood, fitting it on the carved surface, and the crafts made using this <i>Maki-e</i> technique. This technique has been widely used for furnishing, accessories, and sword fittings since ancient times. <br><br>This pen nib has an exquisite, delicate feel and a responsive touch, ensuring beautiful handwriting regardless of the pressure applied while writing. After nearly a century of experience producing high-end writing instruments, Platinum Pen created the nib designed with a slightly harder and moderate resistance. This nib is suited to heavy-handed writers, as well as those with a delicate touch.<br></p>\n<p><i>The origin of the name \"Izumo\"</i><br><br>Japan has its pride in its four distinct seasons. All with an intent to live in harmony with nature while creating and developing a rich culture with the beliefs in the presences of gods in nature. Since the dawn of time, it has been believed that the gods reside in all things and that there is a common ground where the gods throughout Japan gather together once a year. This is <i>\"Izumo\"</i>, a great influence over the structure of Japan and the heart of its people, thus contributing to the prosperity of the city. <br><br>The word <i>\"Izumo\"</i>, which expresses the many-layered cloud formations rising vigorously to the sky, had been handed down to the present day. <i>\"Izumo\"</i> also expresses the idea of progress and creation.<br><br>Based on such an idea, Platinum Pen created a highly original luxury writing instruments brand named <i>\"Izumo\"</i> with the best intent of expressing the wonderful Japanese traditional art and the quality material, to be passed on to the future generation. The company founder <i>Shunichi Nakata</i> was born in <i>Izumo</i> city, the city in <i>Shimane</i> prefecture in Japan where <i>\"IzumoTaisha\"</i> Shurine is. The magnificent influence of nature and a mysterious history exist. Derived from such fact, the <i>\"Izumo\"</i> series was created with the best wishes of obtaining the momentum of clouds rising to the heaven.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Platinum Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/platinum-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Platinum ink cartridges.</p>\n<p>Note: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i>Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

    "description": "<p>Since its launch in 2007, the Platinum Preppy fountain pen series has grown in popularity among a wide range of age groups around the world. The all new Platinum Prefounte is a model designed more for adults that boasts a sense of high quality while retaining the basic functions of Preppy fountain pen. Subdued colors are employed for the transparent body made of resin. The graphics are also kept simple, while the metal clip adds an accent to produce a chic, translucent appearance ideal for adults. The stainless steel nib features a welded tip made of an abrasion-resistant special alloy, which provides an excellent writing feel.</p>\n<p>The Prefounte fountain pen is equipped with Platinum's \u201cSlip &amp; Seal Mechanism\u201d that prevents ink from drying out in the pen with the cap on for one year. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges (one blue-black cartridge is included) or a Platinum converter (sold separately) to fill with bottled ink.</p>\n\n<p>For those who seek a smart and casual fountain pen, the Prefounte is ideal for both business and daily use, as well as for fountain pen beginners.</p>\n<p>By converting this pen to an eyedropper, you can fill the entire barrel with ink for maximum ink capacity! All you need to do is add an o-ring and a small amount of silicone grease to the threads (available separately).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/platinum-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Platinum Ink Cartridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Platinum ink cartridges.</p>",

The all new Platinum Prefounte is a model designed more for adults that boasts a sense of high quality while retaining the basic functions of Preppy fountain pen. Subdued colors are employed for the transparent body made of resin. The graphics are also kept simple, while the metal clip adds an accent to produce a chic, translucent appearance ideal for adults. The stainless steel nib features a welded tip made of an abrasion-resistant special alloy, which provides an excellent writing feel.</p>\n<p>The Prefounte fountain pen is equipped with Platinum's \u201cSlip &amp; Seal Mechanism\u201d that prevents ink from drying out in the pen with the cap on for one year. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges (one blue-black cartridge is included) or a Platinum converter (sold separately) to fill with bottled ink.</p>\n\n<p>For those who seek a smart and casual fountain pen, the Prefounte is ideal for both business and daily use, as well as for fountain pen beginners.</p>\n<p>By converting this pen to an eyedropper, you can fill the entire barrel with ink for maximum ink capacity! All you need to do is add an o-ring and a small amount of silicone grease to the threads (available separately).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/platinum-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Platinum Ink Cartridges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here </a>to shop all compatible Platinum ink cartridges.</p>",

Dupont utilizes a specialized carbon graphite composite, a material synonymous with luxury, used in the production of modern day 'super' cars and rare mechanical timepieces. The final result is ultra-lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n<p>The Carbon Graphite collection is crafted in S.T. Dupont\u2019s \u2018oversize\u2019 Line D writing instrument. Each pen features Dupont\u2019s bold blazon on the articulated clip in black enamel, an enhanced Dupont 'D' in the crown of the cap and a perfectly balanced shape for exceptional writing. The pen cap closes with Dupont's iconic 'cling' and features a fluted grip section for a superb writing experience.</p>\n<p>Perfectly engraved into each pen cap is Dupont\u2019s iconic 'micro diamond head' design, emboldened with a matte black finish, perfectly accenting the vibrant colors of the carbon composite.</p>\n<p>This black and white carbon graphite fountain pen is complemented by matte black PVD and ruthenium trim.

Dupont is a leading brand of luxury products designed and made in France. Founded in Paris in 1847 by its namesake Simon Tissot Dupont, today S.T. Dupont is world famous for their exceptional writing instruments. S.T. Dupont has been a supplier to Royals, Aristocracy and celebrities including: Coco Chanel, Leonardo DiCaprio, the British royal family, Audrey Hepburn, and Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s, S.T. Dupont perfected the bonding of the nigh indestructible Urushi lacquer onto metal, offering a strong luxurious finish to their writing instruments. The company mastered the art of fine lacquer by rediscovering and perfecting ancient Japanese and Chinese techniques. This process has become a staple of the luxury S.T. Dupont brand through the present day.</p>\n<p>S.T. Dupont products are still made at the original workshop located in Faverges near the French Alps. Their writing instruments are world renowned for precise engineering and intricate goldsmith manufacture. They are committed to innovation and cutting-edge technology while also retaining status as a Heritage brand.</p>",

    "description": "<p>S.T. Dupont is renowned worldwide for crafting exceptional writing instruments of superior quality and design. The new \u2018Fire-head\u2019 guilloche is no exception and demonstrates one of S.T. Dupont\u2019s oldest and most treasured crafting techniques 'guilloche under lacquer'. S.T. Dupont\u2019s iconic \u2018Fire-head\u2019 guilloche pays tribute to the much celebrated \u2018Louvre\u2019 museum in Paris, France, famed for its glass \u2018pyramid\u2019 entrance, which serves as the design inspiration. <br><br>Guilloche is an intricate decorative technique created by engraving a surface with great precision and then adding a transparent layer of resin, enamel, or in the case of S.T. Dupont\u2019s fine writing instruments, a natural lacquer over the engraved surface. S.T. Dupont engineers engrave a series of \u2018pyramids\u2019 throughout the barrel and cap of each pen using an \u2018engine turning\u2019 process that engraves very precise and intricate geometric patterns into an underlying material. <br><br>S.T. Dupont's artisans then add layers of natural lacquer to the solid brass engraved pen in a month's long process. Many layers of application and polishing impart depth and mystery to each finish, resulting in a smooth, unique texture on the surface. The engraved guilloche reflects light through the overlay of natural lacquer, creating a spectacular three dimensional display of color. <br><br>The Firehead Guilloche collection is launched on the Line D Large pen; recently remodeled with a new bold blazon on the articulated clip, an enhanced Dupont 'D' in the crown of the cap and a perfectly balanced shape for exceptional writing. The pen cap closes with Dupont's iconic 'cling' and features a fluted grip section for a superb writing experience. This graphite gray colored fountain pen is accented with matte black trim and a black plated 14t gold nib and fills via cartridge/converter (included).<br><br>Each fountain pen receives over 150 handcrafted operations and controls to ensure writing perfection. The fountain pen features S.T. Dupont's famous 'click' to echo their famous lighter 'cling'. <br><br>With the natural lacquer exclusive patina effect, each piece is one of a kind. While the procedure remains the same, the result is always different. Depending on the color contrasts obtained, the handmade production process gives the product its very own depth and soul.</p>\n<p><em>Company Background:</em><br></p>\n<p>S.T. Dupont is a leading brand of luxury products designed and made in France. Founded in Paris in 1847 by its namesake Simon Tissot Dupont, today S.T. Dupont is world famous for their exceptional writing instruments. S.T. Dupont has been a supplier to Royals, Aristocracy and celebrities including: Coco Chanel, Leonardo DiCaprio, the British royal family, Audrey Hepburn, and Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s, S.T. Dupont perfected the bonding of the nigh indestructible Urushi lacquer onto metal, offering a strong luxurious finish to their writing instruments. The company mastered the art of fine lacquer by rediscovering and perfecting ancient Japanese and Chinese techniques. This process has become a staple of the luxury S.T. Dupont brand through the present day.</p>\n<p>S.T. Dupont products are still made at the original workshop located in Faverges near the French Alps. Their writing instruments are world renowned for precise engineering and intricate goldsmith manufacture. They are committed to innovation and cutting-edge technology while also retaining status as a Heritage brand.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sailor is celebrating a milestone in 2021: their 110th year anniversary. When Sailor Pen\u2019s founder, Kyugoro Sakata, pioneered Japanese fountain pen manufacturing in 1911, he had a vision of the perfect writing instrument, manufactured in Japan, and fitted with premium quality gold nibs. 110 years later, Sailor is the leading manufacturer of gold nib fountain pens as well as having the distinction of making the only 21-karat gold nibs in the world. To celebrate this momentous occasion, Sailor is releasing a limited edition 110th Anniversary Commemorative Fountain Pen series. <br><br>A limited edition BESPOKE production of only 110 pieces, this model is only available to selected SAILOR North American Bespoke Dealers. Made with stainless steel and coated deep black through a new electrolytic coloration technology, it gives this pen a firm metallic feel with the durability of a non-fading deep black finish. The 21-karat matte gold band on the barrel illuminates its elegance and accentuates the look and feel of ultimate luxury.<br><br>This pen features a special limited edition 21-karat bicolor nib engraved with Sailor's new anchor logo and \u201c110th\u201d. It is available in four nib widths: Fine, Medium-Fine, Medium, and Broad.<br><br>A centerband on the cap is engraved with the new Sailor logo \u2013 reflecting beauty through simplicity.

The pen captures this profound aesthetic through its unique construction.</span><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0<u></u><u></u><span>The pen is developed and finished by renowned Urushi artist Wayo Shimamori. It features the highly complex Irogasane Sabinuri technique, an intricate application of Urushi lacquer that creates a deep, multi-layered visual texture, reflecting the natural, evolving beauty of the Wabi Sabi concept.</span><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>It is crafted from premium Ebonite, providing a unique warmth and feel in the hand that is prized by collectors.</span><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The heart of the pen is Sailor's signature, oversized 21K solid gold King of Pen nib, finished with gold plating.</span></p>\n<p>Urushi lacquer is made of sap from trees grown only in East Asian countries that take 15 years to reach maturity. After years of patience and care, the sap is then harvested and mixed into lacquer, hand applied to the ebonite pen surface, and kept in high humidity until it sets into a lustrous finish that is waterproof and extraordinarily durable.\u00a0<br><br>This fountain pen comes with a Sailor proprietary converter, a proprietary Sailor ink cartridge, a pen sleeve, and a cleaning cloth. It is limited to 20 pieces worldwide.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note: the Wabi Sabi pens are not designed to have the cap posted; this is to protect the Sabinuri Urushi lacquer.</em></p>\n<p><em>The actual pen received may vary slightly from the images shown.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i>Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

It comes equipped with Sailor's legendary 21k gold nib in black with a Naginata Togi nib grind available in three nib sizes. It also has a black ion-plated brass grip section for a weighted balance.</p>\n<p>This special Naginata Togi nib allows you to write with a thin line when holding the pen vertically upright, or with a thicker line when holding the pen at a lower writing angle. In this way it\u2019s similar to a Sailor Zoom nib. It also is ground so that it writes thicker on the cross stroke and thinner on the down stroke, like an Architect nib. It\u2019s really a blend of Zoom and Architect, which is quite unique and not available from any other pen manufacturer.</p>\n<p>The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing. Each pen comes equipped with a black ion-plated ink converter, perfectly complementing the pen\u2019s sleek design.

It comes equipped with Sailor's legendary rhodium-plated 21k gold nib with a Naginata Togi nib grind available in three nib sizes.</p>\n<p>This special Naginata Togi nib allows you to write with a thin line when holding the pen vertically upright, or with a thicker line when holding the pen at a lower writing angle. In this way it\u2019s similar to a Sailor Zoom nib. It also is ground so that it writes thicker on the cross stroke and thinner on the down stroke, like an Architect nib. It\u2019s really a blend of Zoom and Architect, which is quite unique and not available from any other pen manufacturer.</p>\n<p>A special engraved metallic centerband infilled with resin using the special Cloisonn\u00e9 technique signifies the special nib.</p>\n<p>The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing. The 1911L comes with a Sailor proprietary converter as well as two proprietary Sailor Black ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>",

The Ninja's missions included night raids, sabotage, and assassination,\u00a0but the most important mission was to invade the enemy's camp,\u00a0gather information on the enemy's situation, and convey this<br>information to the lord.<br></p>\n<p>Thus, because the Ninja needed to survive and return to their lord\u00a0living in castles, they often used weapons to protect themselves, such\u00a0as Swords, Shurikens, Makibishi etc.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Crafted from PMMA Resin with Yuubi Maki-e, this pen is a true work of art. This Sailor 1911 Large fountain pen features different maki-e designs on the translucent grey barrel and cap.

    "description": "<p>Following the road of yellow bricks is all fun and games until you run into the Wicked Witch of the West! Inspired by the classic novel, \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" the new Sailor 1911 Wicked Witch of the West pen asks the question that only fountain pen fanatics would ponder: What kind of pen would the Wicked Witch carry?<br><br>Sailor's answer? A fountain pen with a dark purple semi-translucent barrel, black trim, and an ion-plated (IP) black nib of course!<br><br>A North American exclusive, this Sailor 1911 Standard fountain pen features a dark eggplant purple resin barrel and cap. It is complemented by black ion-plated accents, and comes equipped with Sailor's legendary black ion 14k gold nib in a wide variety of nib sizes. The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing. The 1911S comes with a Sailor proprietary converter as well as two proprietary Sailor Black ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Note:</b> Sailor has fully transitioned to the new design of nib that features the anchor logo only.

    "description": "<p>Kabazaiku, or cherry bark woodworking art work, is a traditional Japanese art work which fluorished in Kaunodate in Akita prefecture of Japan. The technique was used 250 years ago by Samurai warriors to decorate their weapons. The same uncompromising spirit of quality and workmanship has been handed down the generations to the producer of the 'Kabazaiku\" Cherry Bark \u2013 Denshiro Shouten. Each pen shows a unique pattern of wild Cherry bark and gives a warm, natural feeling in the hands.</p>\n<p>The barrel and cap are made of brass, with a wild cherry bark covering, complemented by gold-plated accents. The fountain pen comes equipped with Sailor's legendary 14k gold nib with 24kt gold plating in medium. It comes in an exclusive gift box with a 50ml bottle of Sailor Black ink and an ink converter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><em><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Note:</b> Sailor has fully transitioned to the new design of nib that features the anchor logo only.

    "description": "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">This oversized Sailor King of Pens fountain pen features a gorgeous ebonite cap, barrel and grip section. Each UMESAKI pen is meticulously crafted with a 21K gold KOP Naginata Togi nib, renowned for its exceptional writing quality and durability.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Colored ebonite fountain pen UMESAKI, available in a limited quantity, features Sailor Pen's special 21K gold KOP Naginata Togi nib, and is crafted with the Chirashi technique for an intricate yet stately allure. As with other models in this annually released series, the body's design is inspired by a masterpiece of traditional Japanese art, expressed with colored ebonite. This year's model is Sailor's interpretation of \"Plum Estate in Kameido\" by Hiroshige Utagawa as published in the \"One Hundred Famous Views of Edo\". Regarded highly by the world, as evident in Vincent van Gogh's reproduction \"Flowering Plum Tree\", they brought the image to life with UMESAKI.<br></p>\n<p>Plum Estate in Kameido was a plum orchard situated behind Kameido Tenjin Shrine, that became famous for \"Garyubai\", meaning a plum tree shaped like a sleeping\u00a0dragon. It was a hugely popular sightseeing spot in spring, even known to be cherished by Yoshimune Tokugawa, the 8th Shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate.\u00a0The portrayal of sightseers enjoying the view from beyond the fence is testimony to the estate's popularity. Depicting closer objects as close-ups and farther objects in\u00a0smaller size was Hiroshige's preferred composition. He also succeeded in giving the tree a convincing woody texture by layering paint.</p>\n<p>Engraved with a serial number, each piece is unique. <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">UMESAKI is a limited edition of only 500 pieces worldwide, made available only through authorized Sailor Bespoke dealers. Each pen is individually numbered.</p>\n<p>UMESAKI comes in a new dark brown wooden gift box in\u00a0the image of plum wood, different from packaging for\u00a0past models of this series.\u00a0The inside is lined with exquisitely elegant crape fabric, a\u00a0reproduction of traditional \"Chirimen\" that has been cherished in Japan since ancient times, and adorned with\u00a0sleeves in color inspired by dainty plum blossoms.\u00a0The inside is lined with an exquisitely elegant crape, Chirimen, fabric, a reproduction of a\u00a0traditional material that has existed in Japan since ancient times.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This special Naginata Togi nib allows you to write with a thin line when holding the pen vertically upright, or with a thicker line when holding the pen at a lower writing angle. In this way it\u2019s similar to a Sailor Zoom nib. It also is ground so that it writes thicker on the cross stroke and thinner on the down stroke, like an Architect nib. It\u2019s really a blend of Zoom and Architect, which is quite unique and not available from any other pen manufacturer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i>Please note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

Additionally, the fingerprint-resistant surface keeps the pen looking clean and beautiful, maintaining its pristine appearance over time.</p>\n<p>The Professional Gear Ginza Silver Matte Grip Fountain Pen pays homage to Ginza, a district synonymous with luxury and refinement. In the Edo period, Ginza was the site of a silver coin mint for the shogunate, and the name \u201cGinza\u201d itself translates to \u201cSilver\u201d in English. As Western culture permeated Japan during the Meiji era, Ginza emerged as the epicenter of cutting-edge fashion. Today, Ginza remains a symbol of opulence and sophistication, reflecting its illustrious past and contemporary elegance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This Sailor Pro Gear fountain pen features a black barrel and cap, complemented by rhodium-plated accents, and a matte chrome-plated brass grip section. The flat top cap features the Sailor anchor logo inset into the top finial. It comes equipped with Sailor's legendary rhodium plated 21k gold nib in a wide variety of nib sizes. The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing.</p>\n<p>The Professional Gear fountain pen comes with a Sailor proprietary converter as well as two proprietary Sailor Black ink cartridges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>",

The pen cap showcases auspicious patterns traditionally found on kimonos, while the barrel artfully represents the folds of a kimono collar, creating a harmonious blend of cultural homage and elegant design. The designs include motifs drawn from nature, floral arrangements, and geometric forms, reflecting the rich tapestry of Japanese aesthetics.</p>\n<p>The Happiness pen is white with a blue grip and red throughout. The Sailor Pro Gear Slim fountain pen is equipped with a 14k gold nib in fine, medium fine, or medium. The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing. Each pen comes with a proprietary Sailor converter.</p>",

To thank them, she played a \u201ckoto\u201d harp beautifully each day on the beach, but soon fell ill and passed away. Ever since, the beach sand became musical sand, and the beach was named \u201cBeach of Koto.\u201d</p>\n<p>This Sailor Pro Gear Slim fountain pen features a light blue resin barrel, a sandy brown resin cap, and applied details of seashells and waves. The flat top cap features the Sailor anchor logo inset into the top finial. It comes equipped with Sailor's legendary rhodium-plated 14k gold nib and is complemented by rhodium-plated accents. The cap screws to open/close and can push to post onto the back of the barrel when writing.<br><br>The Professional Gear Slim fountain pen comes with a Sailor proprietary converter as well as two proprietary Sailor Black ink cartridges. <a title=\"Sailor Ink Cartridges\" href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/sailor-ink-cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible Sailor ink cartridges.</p>",

The Anni60 black resin body is complemented by ultra black PVD-plated trim, and fills with a built-in piston mechanism. It is fitted with an in-house made nib in 14k gold Flexible sizes with an ebonite feed. Each pen comes with a matching pen sleeve made of genuine leather and cotton.</p>\n<p>The SCRIBO FEEL Anni60 fountain pen is made in a limited quantity of 219.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, the dandy style made a comeback, fueled by a rebellious youth culture and a fashion revolution that broke away from established conventions. A new generation embraced elegance as a form of individual expression. Rejecting conformity, this generation reimagined the elegant dandy style of the 19th century with a bold mix of sophistication and theatrical flair.</p>\n<p>Attention to detail became an act of rebellion, and with appearance treated as an expression of art, the dandy style was a challenge to established norms. The dandy became a modern icon of defiance, straddling tradition and revolution, a walking symbol of an era where fashion was much more than just style: it was identity, loud and unapologetic.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of 1960s dandy style, the FEEL Anni60 captures this same rebellious elegance. Through the art of the Guilloch\u00e9 technique, mastered by the Italian company Renzetti, FEEL Anni60 revolutionizes the balance between tradition and innovation.</p>\n<p>The Anni\u2019 60 pattern, so refined and with a vintage flavor, adorns the FEEL Anni60 and was used for a long time in high jewelry and watchmaking. The design replicates the effect of antique lace and has recently returned to prominence with applications in various fields, especially in design and high fashion, with surprising results. For the first time, it is featured on a writing instrument made of resin.</p>\n<p>The artistic Guilloch\u00e9 engraving is done entirely by hand and is still operated exclusively mechanically today. It is an ancient art achieved by tracing one line at a time with various tools, creating a harmonious design on metal, resin, and wood surfaces. Its earliest record dates back to the year 1624, found engraved on some vintage watch cases featuring this craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>Only a few companies in the world master and preserve the true artisanal Guilloch\u00e9 method, making every engraved object even more precious and unique thanks to the skilled hand of the artisan. The company Renzetti1909, with its expertise, SCRIBO's partner for this exclusive collection, represents one of the leading exponents of this ancient craft.</p>\n<p>As in the best tradition of hand writing instruments, every stylistic detail of the FEEL has been conceived, designed and manufactured to create a unique fountain pen that stands out in the search for the best writing experience.</p>\n<p>The body of the pen, which slips into the shape of the Doric column, is turned by hand from a solid bar. The cap, the barrel and the knob, characterized by a slight entasis that enhances the shape, describe a statuesque object with a neo-classical, elegant and timeless design.</p>\n<p>Even the nib-holder, before tapering to the classic circular section, is finished with a hint of facet that facilitates the handle and allows you to better manage the angle which you want to use the nib with.</p>\n<p>The nib of the FEEL, the SCRIBO cornerstone, is the real protagonist of this writing instrument. The 14-carat gold Flexible nib is the same nib used by Omas and that is for SCRIBO the first brick to start again a brand-new story of Italian creativity.</p>\n<p>The perfect match for this historic nib is undoubtedly the ebonite feeder, which enhances the always ready, generous, soft and precise writing, thanks to the use of the classic piston filling system.</p>\n<p>The SCRIBO FEEL is accompanied by a genuine leather and cotton handmade soft pouch realized to protect two writing instruments.

    "description": "<p>The SCRIBO PIUMA A Riveder Le Stelle is born from this upward gaze. From the need to lift our heads, search for direction, and recognize beauty even in darkness. An ancient gesture that has always been with us: looking up at the sky and letting ourselves be filled with wonder. On clear nights, stars seem to whisper.</p>\n<p>The name of this fountain pen is an invitation. It is inspired by the final verse of Dante\u2019s Inferno, when darkness gives way to light, when Dante and Virgilio emerge from the abyss and the sky lights up once again above them. A verse that still reminds us today how powerful even a single fragment of light can be. The body, made of deep and translucent midnight blue resin, evokes the night sky dotted with stars. Palladium-finished details shine like thin lines of distant galaxies, tracing a secret map between the sky and the page.<br></p>\n<p>PIUMA \u2013 A riveder le stelle is made in just 219 pieces.\u00a0Each fountain pen is unique, like every truly starry night.\u00a0An invitation to slow down, observe, and entrust to ink what deserves to remain.</p>\n<p>Handmade in Italy, the SCRIBO PIUMA fountain pen features a seamless barrel and cap. The blue resin body is complemented by palladium trim, and fills with a cartridge/converter (included). It is fitted with an in-house made nib in 14k gold Flexible sizes or 18k gold standard sizes, with an ebonite feed.

    "description": "<p>Aras, with their flamboyant plumage and lively\u00a0personalities, are among the most iconic parrots\u00a0in the world. Native to the tropical regions of\u00a0Central and South America, these fascinating\u00a0birds embody the exotic beauty and lush\u00a0biodiversity of their natural habitats and are\u00a0considered as radiant jewels of the Tropics.</p>\n<p>The most distinctive feature of Aras is undoubtedly their\u00a0plumage. Each species sports a unique combination of\u00a0vibrant colors, ranging from fiery red to sunny\u00a0yellow, cobalt blue to emerald green.</p>\n<p>Beyond their beauty and allure, Aras play a crucial\u00a0ecological role, maintaining the delicate balance of\u00a0tropical ecosystems. Spotting an Ara in its natural\u00a0environment is an unforgettable experience, a reminder\u00a0of the fragile beauty and precious biodiversity our\u00a0planet harbors.</p>\n<p>Handmade in Italy, the SCRIBO PIUMA fountain pen\u00a0are inspired by the bright colors of the plumage of these tropical birds and are a genuine rainbow of colors, fixed by hand with brush and airbrush. Finally, the color layering is protected by a special\u00a0anti-UV lacquer to protect its luminosity over time. It is complemented by platinum trim, and fills with a cartridge/converter (included). It is fitted with an in-house made nib in 14k gold Flexible sizes or 18k gold standard sizes, with an ebonite feed. Each pen comes with a matching pen sleeve made of genuine leather and cotton.<br></p>\n<p>PIUMA Ara is a limited production run of 90 pieces.</p>\n<p>About SCRIBO:</p>\n<p>SCRIBO, short for <i>Scrittura Bolognese</i>, was founded by former employees of the retired OMAS brand. Fundamental values include writing tradition, design, craftsmanship, and made in Italy. Every working component of the fountain pen is handmade. The heart of every SCRIBO fountain pen is the gold nib. The classic 18-carat alloy and the special Extra-Flexible 14-carat alloy both offer elasticity, mechanical memory, and softness that highlights every fountain pen's writing quality.</p>",

    "description": "<p>2022 was the year of Five Yellow Tigers, a very special time which occurs once every 36 years. The year of Five Yellow Tigers is deeply connected to the traditional Chinese folklore. <br><br>The legend is rooted in the Nine Star Ki and the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac. It is said that every 36 years the fifth star, which is associated with Saturn, and the Five Yellow Tigers meet to create an extraordinary powerful leader. This individual is gifted with natural disposition for leadership and possesses innate power that overshadows those around it. We wish that this Soaring Tiger brings you great prosperity and an abundance of peace. <br><br>In celebration of this special year, Taccia's famous Chinkin artist presents one of the most delicate Japanese Maki-e techniques. The Empress Chinkin Tiger Maki-e LE pen is masterfully carved to accentuate the power exuding from the Soaring Tiger while highlighting the three-dimensional beauty and intricacies of the Chinkin technique. <br><br>Each Taccia Empress Chinkin Tiger Maki-e LE pen is fitted with an exceptional 18K gold \u201cKing of Pen\" nib, made in Japan exclusively for Taccia. This stunning pen is limited to 36 pens, available exclusively in North America.</p>\n<p>The airtight cushion seal cap allows for a snug closure. Each limited edition fountain pen is individually numbered out of 36, and is accompanied with a certificate of authenticity. It comes packaged in a wooden gift box and comes with a cloth pen wrap.

Each TACCIA Empress LE pen is fitted with a significant 18K gold \"King of Pen\" nib, made in Japan exclusively for TACCIA.<br></p>\n<p>The Empress Koi Oasis fountain pen is enhanced with exquisite designs of Koi fish swimming with water lilies and lily pads.

The pen fills with either a proprietary Sailor converter or Sailor ink cartridges; both are included.<br></p>\n<p><em>Please note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

    "description": "<p>In crafting the TACCIA Miyabi Wajima Azure Wave fountain pen, the maki-e artist employed the exquisite Kawari Nuri technique, infusing it with captivating blue hues. The Kawari-Nuri, a technique dating back to the early 17th centuries, originated from the innovative experimentation with diverse material and structures.</p>\n<p>In this precise process, the artist begins by carefully selecting an appropriate amount of Urushi, applying it to the designated area of a pen via a stippling method using a special brush, and allowing it to dry. This sequence is repeated for each color in the design. Once the Urushi dots have been applied and dried, the artist meticulously rubs the surface to achieve a smooth finish. If unsatisfied, he starts anew, ensuring perfection in every details.</p>\n<p>This TACCIA Miyabi fountain pen has urushi lacquer in a speckled pattern, with accents of gold, and is accented by silver trim. The airtight cushion seal cap allows for a snug closure. Each limited edition fountain pen is individually numbered out of 20 on the bottom of the barrel.</p>\n<p>Each fountain pen is made by hand in TACCIA's Urushi studio in Wajima. It comes fitted with a bi-color 18k gold nib made in Japan. And to bring historical craftsmanship into your hand, each series is limited and signed by the maki-e artisan.</p>\n<p>This fountain pen comes packaged in a wooden gift box and comes with a cloth pen sleeve. The pen fills with either a proprietary Sailor converter or Sailor ink cartridges; both are included.</p>\n<p><i>Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

    "description": "<p>The TWSBI Diamond 580ALR comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. This special edition fountain pen has a deep teal blue aluminum grip section, cap ring, and piston knob. The aluminum is enhanced with a subtle matte finish, with circular engravings in the grip and cap area. It comes with a stainless steel nib and is presented in a modern clear display case.</p>\n<p>The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI's goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate.<br><br> The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present.<br><br> TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.</p>\n\n<p>You may notice a white substance on your 580AL or 580ALR pistons. This is bearing grease, and must not be removed during cleanings, or replaced by silicone grease.</p>",

It is completed with a silver stainless steel nib.</p>\n<p>It is incredibly easy to fill this pen from bottled ink - simply unscrew the barrel to access the plunger, submerge the pen\u2019s nib down into the ink, press down on the piston to compress the spring, and it will fill the barrel with ink!

    "description": "<p>Visconti is pleased to announce the \"Comedia\" collection inspired by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 in Florence and is considered to be the greatest Italian poet who has ever lived. He is also known as the father of the Italian language as we know it. His most important work \"Comedia\" later known as the Divine Comedy, (Divina Comedia), is a masterpiece of world literature that explores the afterlife through three realms: Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. Each realm is depicted with vivid imagery and symbolism, reflecting Dante's moral and spiritual vision of life. Inspired by this epic poem, Visconti has created a new collection that captures the essence of each realm in its design and craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>Each pen features special trims and colored resins designed specifically to express the imagery particular to each of Dante's realms. The Inferno (Hell) is made of solid black resin with flaming-red accents and dark ruthenium trims, evoking the fire and darkness of the Inferno.</p>\n<p>These three different versions of the Comedia\u00a0are united by the unique design of the central ring, crafted specifically for this collection, featuring two bands covered in a hammered texture - a detail also found in the pens' distinctive metal section.

    "description": "<p>Visconti is pleased to announce the \"Comedia\" collection inspired by Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 in Florence and is considered to be the greatest Italian poet who has ever lived. He is also known as the father of the Italian language as we know it. His most important work \"Comedia\" later known as the Divine Comedy, (Divina Comedia), is a masterpiece of world literature that explores the afterlife through three realms: Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. Each realm is depicted with vivid imagery and symbolism, reflecting Dante's moral and spiritual vision of life. Inspired by this epic poem, Visconti has created a new collection that captures the essence of each realm in its design and craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>Each pen features special trims and colored resins designed specifically to express the imagery particular to each of Dante's realms. Paradiso (Heaven) is a celestial sky-blue with yellow gold trim, symbolizing the holy light and joyful nobility of paradise.</p>\n<p>These three different versions of the Comedia\u00a0are united by the unique design of the central ring, crafted specifically for this collection, featuring two bands covered in a hammered texture - a detail also found in the pens' distinctive metal section. Each individual ring is then individually engraved by craftsmen with the inscription \"Comedia\" followed by the name of the specific model - Inferno, Purgatorio or Paradiso.</p>\n<p>A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short and long cartridges.

    "description": "<p>The Visconti Divina fountain pen features a classic spiral shape evoking the nautilus, a symbol of divine proportion</p>\n<p>For this new Matte collection, Visconti started with the iconic design of the Divina and placed it in a contemporary context, freeing it from the classic silver elements. The only protagonist of this collection is the color black which, in the matte version, gives the pen a mysterious, rebellious, and sensual character. This timeless color is featured in all the metal elements of the pen, made of silver and finished in ruthenium.<br><br> The Visconti Divina Matte Black fountain pen fills with the Visconti pull and turn piston mechanism. It is completed with a ruthenium-plated 14k gold nib and Visconti's patented 'Hook Safe Lock' capping system. This pen is set in a gift box with a manual and is covered by Visconti\u2019s 2-year warranty.</p>",

A large section of lava has been cut out of the pens body and replaced with a piece of clear crystal acrylic tube, transforming the pen into a demonstrator with a unique appearance and identity. This 'oversize' window offers the user a view of stored ink inside the pen and the pens 'double reservoir' power filling system<br><br> <strong>Double Reservoir:</strong> The original Homo Sapiens featured Visconti's 'single reservoir' power filling system. The Crystal Dream is upgraded to Visconti's patented 'double reservoir' power filler, a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel.<br><br> <strong>Crystal Ring:</strong> The final change is the small ring around the pens grip section. Metal has been replaced with crystal acrylic resin, offering a view of stored ink in the pens second smaller ink reservoir.<br><br> As with the original Homo Sapiens, the Crystal Dream is made from volcanic lava rock making the pen virtually unbreakable, naturally hygroscopic and very comfortable to write with. All trims are made from natural bronze and the cap closes with Visconti's patented 'hook safe lock'. The Homo Sapiens Crystal Dream is a must-have for every Visconti pen enthusiast.</p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens is handmade from hardened basaltic lava sourced from the Mount Etna volcano in Italy, with a trim made of solid bronze. Visconti lava is virtually unbreakable, comfortable and warm to the touch - and slightly hygroscopic, absorbing moisture from your hand. The basaltic lava is mixed with resin to create this pen.</p>\n<p>The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen's double reservoir vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it features a rose gold-plated oversized 18k gold nib to match the trim color.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Through the Homo Sapiens Earth Origins collection, Visconti has paid homage to the primordial forces of the universe, capturing their essence in precious writing instruments. Now, with the final chapter of this exceptional journey, we present the most precious element: Aether. Limited to 388 pieces worldwide.</p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens Earth Origins Aether pen is crafted from a mesmerizing bluish-purple resin made by Jonathon Brooks, a shade long associated with nobility, wisdom and the infinite sky. The celestial hue, shifting between deep violet and radiant indigo, captures the essence of the cosmic unknown.</p>\n<p>The pen is embellished with rose gold trim, a warm and luminous contrast that enhances its aura of refinement and sophistication. The 18kt pure gold nib, designed to offer an exceptional writing experience, reflects the preciousness and mastery\u00a0that distinguish Visconti.</p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens features a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel. This revolutionary closing system is very satisfying to operate and was created to lock the pen body into the cap to prevent the possibility of the pen accidentally unscrewing and leaking inside a pocket or bag.</p>\n<p>It comes with Visconti's 18kt gold in-house nib hand-crafted and manufactured in Florence, Italy. Available in EF, F, M, and B.</p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

Earth, wind, fire, and water interacting to form the materials of our existence. Inspired by the mythical and primordial forces that shaped our planet and ignited the very spark of human existence, this collection embodies the essence of timeless energy and boundless inspiration.</span></p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Windy grey hues and dark blue tones interweave with a vibrant iridescent teal bringing life to the \"Air\" edition. These natural resins are mixed and swirled creating images of a hazy, stormy sky. Each pen is accented by silver trim to compliment the cool resin tones. The clip is filled with a bright, iridescent teal - an element that ties back to the Earth and Water editions of the Earth Origins collection.</span></span></p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens features a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits.

    "description": "<p>The Homo Sapiens Carbon Abyssus represents the second chapter of a collection born\u00a0from the desire to unite aesthetics and innovation through the use of cutting-edge\u00a0materials.</p>\n<p>While the first edition celebrated golden reflections immersed in forged carbon, this new creation pushes the boundaries of research even further, transforming matter into a perfect expression of strength and lightness without neglecting elegance.</p>\n<p>To achieve extreme lightness, every metal component has been reimagined: the titanium\u00a0of the first Carbon Moir\u00e9 gives way to Ergal, a special aluminum-based alloy used in\u00a0aerospace engineering, renowned for its exceptional mechanical strength. The result is a\u00a0perfect balance between solidity and writing comfort.</p>\n<p>The carbon itself has also evolved: thanks to even more sophisticated manufacturing techniques, the fibers are denser, creating a stronger and more uniform surface. But it is the introduction of anodized blue aluminum alloy foil that radically transforms the model\u2019s aesthetics. Among the carbon veins, iridescent reflections emerge, evoking the depth of a nocturnal ocean.</p>\n<p>In harmony with these chromatic vibrations, all Ergal metal parts undergo a deep-blue\u00a0anodization process. This finish not only enhances resistance to corrosion and scratches\u00a0but also gives the product a unique stylistic identity. On the clip, the Visconti logo is\u00a0highlighted with a delicate laser engraving, revealing the natural color of the underlying\u00a0metal and creating an elegant contrast.</p>\n<p>The double reservoir power filler is a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel. It also features a magnetic snap cap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, the fountain pen is completed with an in-house made ruthenium plated 18k gold nib. This Limited Edition is individually numbered and limited to 288 pens worldwide. Each pen is presented in a beautifully crafted limited-edition box.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Each of these pens has a different pattern. We do our best to photograph a pen that\u2019s indicative of the average overall aesthetics, but expect some variance when you receive yours. It\u2019ll be one-of-a-kind, just like your unique writing style!</em></p>\n<p><em><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.</em></p>",

These fountain pens feature a custom Architect nib grind by nibmeister Mark Bacas.</p>\n<p>For the Architect nib, Mark starts with a factory nib and grinds away the sides of it, polishing it smooth until it\u2019s like the shape of a blade. This grind enables you to write with a thick cross stroke and thin down stroke, think of it as an inverted stub nib. Architect nibs are particularly dramatic in their line variation when writing print letters, though you can write whatever your personal style and see the variation in the line width pretty easily. They are sometimes also referred to as Hebrew grinds.</p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens is handmade from hardened basaltic lava sourced from the Mount Etna volcano in Italy, with an all-black trim.

    "description": "<p>With the new Homo Sapiens Dark Sapphire and Dark Emerald collection, Visconti explores the tension between darkness and light, between the depth of matter and the brilliance - at times hidden - of precious stones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new Dark Sapphire and Dark Emerald are the result of meticulous aesthetic and material research, born from the harmonious fusion of resins and pigments that blend into soft, irregular veins, illuminated by a metallic finish that evokes the natural gleam of the rarest gemstones. The deep blue of the resin, traced by veins of profound black, evokes the enigmatic allure of sapphire, a gem symbolizing clarity of mind and inner wisdom.</p>\n<p>Every element has been designed to enhance the chromatic depth and purity of the design.<span> </span><span>\u00a0The Dark Sapphire, plated in palladium, reflects the refined coolness of lunar metal. <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Dark Sapphire is the pen for those who write to find themselves again, for those who see reflection as the highest form of intelligence.</span></p>\n<p>The enameled clip, matched in color, completes the visual harmony. Both models are fitted with Visconti's precious 18kt gold nib, a symbol of Italian craftsmanship excellence and a guarantee of a fluid, precise, and harmonious writing experience.</p>\n<p>The double reservoir power filler is a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel.</p>\n<p>The Hook Safe Lock revolutionary cap closing system is very satisfying to operate and was created to lock the pen body into the cap to prevent the possibility of the pen accidentally unscrewing and leaking inside a pocket or bag.</p>\n<p>The Dark Sapphire Limited Edition is individually numbered and limited to 388 pens worldwide. Each pen is presented in a beautifully crafted limited edition box.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Each of these pens has a different pattern and consistency of swirls.

    "description": "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span>With the Homo Sapiens Full Demo, Visconti reinvents its most iconic model, transforming it into a tribute to technical mastery. This is more than a writing instrument - it is a statement of craftsmanship, revealing the hidden beauty of its inner workings.</span></p>\n<p><span><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Born from the union of the distinctive Homo Sapiens design and the allure of demonstrator pens, this edition lays bare the heart of the pen: every internal component has been reimagined to become part of the visual experience. The seals, internal fittings, and even the spring of the bayonet closure are tinged in deep blue, contrasting elegantly with gold-plated metal parts, polished to a mirror finish and engraved with exquisite precision. Completing the design, the external bronze rings recall the legacy of the legendary Lava Bronze.</span></p>\n<p><span><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Crowning this masterpiece is the debut of a new skeletonized nib in 14kt gold, inspired by the art of filigree. Its openwork structure reveals glimpses of the blue feed beneath and offers a uniquely flexible writing experience, capable of adapting line width to the pressure of the hand. Thanks to a re-engineered bayonet system, the nib remains visible even when the pen is closed - its presence, unmistakable. In a world that often favors surface over substance, Visconti chooses to reveal what truly matters: quality, ingenuity, and authentic beauty.</span></p>\n<p>But true innovation lies in the way each detail has been executed. Traditional threads have been replaced by micro-screws, ensuring perfect transparency and an immaculate finish even within the pen's most concealed sections. Every component has been treated as if it were on display - because here it is.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p><span>The Homo Sapiens Full Demo is more than a pen - it is a declaration of style and truth. It is limited to 1,088 pieces worldwide and is numbered out of 1,088 on the finial. The words \"Full Demo\" are on the cap, opposite of the clip.\u00a0<u></u></span></p>\n<p>The Homo Sapiens features a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history.

    "description": "<p>Visconti is proud to announce the launch of the new Homo Sapiens Iris Garden inspired by the Iris Garden in Florence, Italy. This collection is a tribute to the beauty and elegance of the irises that bloom between the end of April and the end of May in the historic Florentine garden, located near the Piazzale Michelangelo and offers a stunning view of the city.</p>\n<p>The history of the so-called \"lily\" of Florence is controversial. It seems that it originated from a white iris, the Iris Florentina, which grew abundantly in the Arno Valley during the Florentine Republic which the people called \"ghiacciolo\" or \"icicle\" for its white, slightly bluish color.</p>\n<p>The iris is not only a symbol of Florence, but also of its rich history and culture. The lily was adapted as the emblem of the city in the 11th century, when it was used to decorate the banners and shields of the Florentine soldiers. The lily also represents wisdom, courage and faith, qualities that have characterized Florence throughout the centuries.</p>\n<p>Like previous limited collections in the Homo Sapiens series, Iris Garden is made from special, semi-transparent demo resins carefully selected by Visconti's designers. The highlight of the collection, however, is the rose gold trims that perfectly match the coloring of the resin and add a touch of light and exquisite detail to the design.</p>\n<p>The double reservoir power filler is a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits. Patented in 1998, this is arguably the most advanced filling system ever developed in fountain pen history. The user is able to fill the pen with the equivalent of 10 cartridges of ink, and thanks to the two reservoirs, prevents ink from leaking during air travel.</p>\n<p>The Hook Safe Lock revolutionary cap closing system is very satisfying to operate and was created to lock the pen body into the cap to prevent the possibility of the pen accidentally unscrewing and leaking inside a pocket or bag.</p>\n<p>Finally, the fountain pen is completed with an in-house made rose gold plated 18k gold nib.</p>\n<p>The Iris Garden Limited Edition is individually numbered and limited to 388 pens worldwide. Each pen is presented in a beautifully crafted limited edition box.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Each of these pens has a different pattern and consistency of swirls. We do our best to photograph a pen that\u2019s indicative of the average overall aesthetics, but expect some variance when you receive yours.

Its spiritual meaning comes to mind as we envisage this beautiful flower, submerged every night in river water, miraculously re-blooming the next morning sparklingly clean. The power of creation is in its DNA, just as it is in ours: Homo Sapiens, the Wise Human.</p>\n<p>For the return of the iconic Homo Sapiens, Visconti has imagined the colors of the lotus garden, the fascinating environment which is home to the delicate flowers of the aquatic plant Nelumbo. Swirls of lilac, green and white resin combine throughout the pen, accentuated by black trim, which recalls the flower\u2019s reflection in dark pond water, adding to its mystery. Each element harmonizes perfectly, creating an elegant and modern collection that invites you to get close to nature and enjoy its incredible power.</p>\n<p>The double reservoir power filler is a vacuum filling system that is easy to use and has considerable benefits.

Both resins were selected for their color saturation and mystifying swirling. The Fire Opal is dusted with gold flecks to add to the luminescence of the orange resin and give a kaleidoscope effect. It is complemented by gold vermeil trim and a 14k gold nib.</p>\n<p>The resin for each pen was made by Jonathon in the USA, and then sent to Italy where it was hand turned at Visconti\u2019s Florentine factory into their iconic 'Kaleido' pen model. A classic Visconti pen that is impeccably designed and weighted offering the perfect everyday writing experience.</p>\n<p>Visconti goes further adding patented innovations that pen enthusiasts have to come to admire and appreciate from Visconti: the iconic 'Ponte Vecchio' bridge clip, Hook Safe Lock closure system, and Visconti\u2019s high power vacuum filling system. Finally Visconti adds a newly detailed ring with a swirled \u2018V\u2019 logo design to accentuate the collection.</p>\n<p>Each pen is individually numbered on the bottom of the barrel.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Visconti is thrilled to announce the launch of the new Medici Briarwood collection. The Medici collection has been redesigned and draws on the best of Visconti's historical heritage and DNA, enriching it with valuable new features such as a new demonstrator central ring, made with the skeletonization technique, which features the official emblem of Florence, the lily. This symbol, found on the city's coat of arms, represents beauty, nobility and pride. As a fundamental element of Florentine culture and tradition since the Middle Ages, it has been represented in paintings by numerous Florentine artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti as a link between Florence and artistic beauty.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the geometry of the Florence Baptistry, the pen's shape was designed following the principles of the golden ratio. The central ring is just one example of the enhancements made to this historical collection, which is a part of Visconti's heritage. The loading system now features a capacious power-filler double reservoir and the clip, which was previously laser-engraved, has been replaced with a new enameled version.</p>\n<p>The pen is made of Acrosilk, an innovative material first introduced by Visconti, which consists of a compound of acrylic resin and silk fibers. For a more contemporary look, this special acrylic blend has been sandblasted to achieve a fine satin finish giving the look of finished wood grain.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This pen features briarwood-colored resin and gold-plated trim. It also has Visconti's 18kt gold in-house gold nib, available in EF, F, M, and B. It's completed with Double Reservoir Power Filler and a Hook Safe Lock.<br></p>\n<p><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>",

Each pen features a beautiful 18kt gold nib with a finish that matches the color of the pen's trim, and a matching enameled clip.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">This elegant new collection is offered in three colorways and is limited to 70 pieces in each color, available exclusively to US retailers only.</p>\n<p><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>",

The center ring is engraved with the inscription, MYTHOS, and a V to emulate a stylized Mount Olympus. The brass grip section has a soft brushed satin finish.</p>\n<p>The pen is completed with a large #6 steel nib with a yellow gold vermeil finish, made by Schmidt in Germany. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short cartridges.</p>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>The iconic design of the Opera collection has been reimagined, drawing inspiration from the history of lyric opera. A tribute to opera masters such as Verdi, Puccini, Mozart and Rossini, whose works of storytelling and musical genius still resonate today with audiences around the world thanks to their flair, brilliance and imagination. The Opera Gold collection is an invitation to remember that greatness always begins with someone somewhere. <br><br> The Opera Gold is a unique and exciting offering from Visconti, a fountain pen that features many of Visconti\u2019s iconic innovations enjoyed and desired by fountain pen enthusiasts, but at a new accessible price point. <br><br> Each fountain pen features details reminiscent of early Visconti designs. The classic \u2018squaring the circle\u2019 shape, a luxurious matte gold finish with detailed engravings and an abundance of innovation. <br><br> The name of the collection, 'Opera' is shown on the front of the ring to enhance the link between Visconti and the city of Florence. The design elements on the remaining sides of the ring include a typical Florentine decoration with four loops inspired by the bronze tiles by Brunelleschi and Ghiberti on the north door of the Baptistery of Santa Maria del Fiore, with the addition of the Visconti \u201cV\u201d from the logo. <br><br> As always, Visconti excels at creating uniquely swirled resins, this time in 3 classic colors. The Opera Gold collection is available in blue, red and black infused with gold marbling. Matte finish gold plated trim completes the elegant design of this classic Visconti pen design featuring a large yellow gold plated stainless steel nib. <br><br> The fountain pen fills using Visconti's patented double reservoir power filler and features a second ink window around the ring of the pen behind the nib. The fountain pen and rollerball versions also feature Visconti's patented hook-safe lock closure and the fountain pen features a newly designed piston rod. <br><br> The fountain pen features Visconti's new, popular large steel nib plated in yellow gold. The nib features Visconti's iconic engraved details.</p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>Made from natural resin uniquely mixed to represent palettes of oil paint, this Visconti Van Gogh series is inspired by the artist's color and technique. Each pen represents a specific Van Gogh painting. The pen utilizes Visconti's eighteen-faceted design, with the many edges enhancing its vivid colors.

Van Gogh accurately reproduced the composition with more intense colors replacing the black and grey of Hiroshige's tree trunk with red and blue tones. He also added the two orange borders with Japanese characters for a decorative and exotic effect.</span></p>\n<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Note: We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here.

    "description": "<p>Visconti's latest launch draws inspiration from one of Van Gogh's most treasured and iconic paintings, 'Sunflowers'. Van Gogh painted with three shades of yellow \u2018and nothing else\u2019. In doing so, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color without any loss of eloquence. <br><br> The Visconti \u2018Sunflowers\u2019 fountain pen is made from natural resin, brought to life by vibrant yellow hues expressing a special significance for Van Gogh: \u2018gratitude\u2019. The meticulous selection of resins and their color mix is one of the major innovations introduced by Visconti and makes each and every Visconti Van Gogh pen unique. The colors are further enhanced by the unique 18 faceted design of the Van Gogh Collection. <br><br> Just like other painters working at the time, Van Gogh created floral themed still-life paintings, but he did things a little differently, experimented with color. After practicing with different flowers, he chose a specific variety: the sunflower. Thinking that these flowers were somewhat coarse and unrefined, Van Gogh gave sunflowers the lead role in several paintings. <br><br> Van Gogh knew that his sunflower paintings were special, as did other people. After he died, friends brought sunflowers with them to his funeral. Sunflowers became synonymous with Van Gogh, just as he had hoped. <br><br> Each fountain pen nib is made from steel and engraved with Van Gogh's signature. A converter is included with each pen, and the fountain pen is presented in a gift box with a bookmark and a bottle of Visconti 'sunny yellow' ink to match the pen. It also accepts standard international short cartridges.</p>\n<p><em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/short-standard-international-cartridges\" title=\"Short Standard International Ink Cartridges\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to shop all compatible short standard international ink cartridges.</p>",

These are not only the main colors of the painting, but also the feelings that we perceive. Looking at the artist's works, impressions become colored, chromatic combinations stir up emotions that find no other name except the name of the color itself. Blue and yellow come to life; they are no longer complements but become the true, compelling subject of the work. This combination of pigments arouses beautiful feelings, which is what Visconti has in mind as they design pens that pay tribute to this great painter of the 1900's.</p>\n<p>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Note: Visconti has been in the process of changing the design on the Van Gogh nib as well as the font featured on the clip.
