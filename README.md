# Recommendle

**Recommendle** is an interactive web game where players compete against an AI recommendation engine to predict fountain pen preferences. Built as a senior design project (CSC 492), it explores **sequential preference modeling** — the idea that user taste can be inferred and updated from a sequence of choices rather than traditional single-item ratings.

---

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding** — You're shown a diverse pool of 50 fountain pens. Pick 10 that appeal to you and rate the set.
2. **10 Rounds of Dueling** — Each round presents 10 candidate pens. You pick one; the AI simultaneously predicts which one you'll choose.
3. **Scoring** — Each round awards 10 points to whoever "wins" (match = AI point, miss = human point). The final score tells you how predictable (or surprising) your taste is.
4. **Leaderboard** — Completed games are ranked by score delta across all players.

The AI uses a lightweight **prefix-based collaborative filtering** model that updates its understanding of your preferences after every pick, combining feature-space similarity (vendor, type, nib, price) with the sequential history of your choices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+** & npm
- **MongoDB** running locally on the default port (`27017`)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilbalaji11/Recommendle.git
cd Recommendle
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file (or copy the example):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Default values in `.env.example`:

```
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB_NAME=decidio
```

Load the product data into MongoDB:

```bash
python -m scripts.load_db
```

Start the API server:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main_mongo:app --host localhost --port 8015 --reload
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

### Production build (optional)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

FastAPI will automatically serve the built frontend from `frontend/dist/` at **http://localhost:8015**.

## The ML Model

The recommendation engine is a **prefix-based collaborative filtering** model inspired by research on sequential preference modeling:

- **Feature space**: Each pen is represented by vendor, product type, tags, nib options, and normalized price.
- **User vector**: Built incrementally — updated after each selection with a decay factor so recent picks weigh more.
- **Prefix ratings**: After onboarding, the user's set-level rating adjusts a per-session bias term.
- **Candidate scoring**: Cosine similarity between the user vector and each candidate, plus the bias term.
- **Diversity**: Onboarding pool and round candidates mix top-likelihood picks with decoy/wildcard items.
